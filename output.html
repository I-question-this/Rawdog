        <p>Back in 2007, Google <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/forum/108194.html">accidentally made public</a> an internal video about Google Reader. The video included <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/09/google-reader-numbers.html">a lot of useful information</a> about Google Reader, the kind of details you'll never find in a Google post or presentation.<br><br>I'm trying to solve the puzzle and find the number of Google Reader users from 2007. Here are the hints:<br><br>1. At that time, Google Reader crawled 8 million feeds.<br><br>2. Two thirds of the feeds had only one subscriber, one third of the feeds had more than one subscriber.<br><br>3. Google Reader used 10TB for storing all the raw data.<br><br>4. The rate of user growth = the rate of growth for the number of feeds.<br><br>5. The index size grew 4% every week.<br><br>6. 70% of the Google Reader traffic came from Firefox (at that time, Firefox's market share was about 15%).<br><br>7. Gmail and orkut were the only Google applications that had a bigger number of pageviews/user than Google Reader.<br><br>8. The main Google Blog had <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/10/subscriber-stats-summed-up.html">100,000 subscribers</a> and this number includes all the subscribers from iGoogle, Reader and orkut.<br><br>So, at that time, only 2.6 million feeds indexed by Google Reader had more than one subscriber. Probably many of the feeds that had only one subscriber were used by other Google services powered by Google Reader's backend (orkut, Blogger widgets, Google Spreadsheets, Ajax API) or they were Google News/Blog Search feeds. It makes sense to assume that the number of Google Reader users was lower than the number of feeds with more than one subscriber.<br><br>Here's a chart from 2010 that shows <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2010/09/welcome-and-look-back.html">Google Reader's user growth</a>:<br><br><br><br>And something else <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2010/04/veritable-boatload-of-read-items.html">from 2010</a>: "the average Reader user reads about 105 items a day".<br><br>It's probably worth distinguishing Reader as a service from Reader as a platform.<div class="feedflare">

  <p>It's par for the course these days; in the lead up to the launch of a new iPhone, leaks come thick and fast. Some are as meaningless as a slightly redesigned speaker bracket, while others could have much larger implications for Apple's flagship product. A purported iPhone "5S" leaked this Thursday, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/06/21/apples-iphone-5s-revealed-in-new-photos/" target="_blank">courtesy of <i>MacRumors</i></a>. Apparently a fairly old prototype, the device has what looks to be a dual-LED flash, along with a 5.92Whr battery, which is around 8 percent larger than the 5.45Whr battery found in the iPhone 5. According to numerous sources, the iPhone 5S will be released this fall alongside a cheaper plastic iPhone.</p>

        <p>Many people think that Google Reader could've been more successful if Google promoted it more. The truth is that Google Reader has been the service that connected to the biggest number of Google services. No other Google benefited from so many service integrations. <br><br>Here's an incomplete list. Start counting:<br><br>1. a link to Reader was <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2012/02/no-new-mail-try-google.html">displayed in Gmail's inbox</a> when there was no mail<br><br>2. for many years, Google Reader could be found <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/01/google-navigation-bar-switch.html">in the main navigation bar</a>, next to Gmail, Calendar and Google Docs<br><br>3. Google Reader was the first Google service that worked offline and the first Google service that <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/05/google-gears-offline-functionality-for.html">used Google Gears</a>, back in 2007<br><br><br><br>4. Google Reader integrated with <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/10/google-social-search.html">Google Social Search</a>, a feature that allowed you to restrict results to the pages written by your friends or people you follow.<br><br><br><br>5. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/07/googles-services-converge-in-new.html">iGoogle integrated with Google Reader</a> when it started to add support for canvas view. Maximize a feed gadget and you get the Google Reader interface.<br><br><br><br>6. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/08/google-reader-adds-blogs-you-follow-in.html">Blogger's Following feature</a> was powered by Google Reader. "The blogs you follow in Blogger have been added as subscriptions in Google Reader. Subscriptions can be managed in Reader without affecting your following list in Blogger."<br><br><br><br>7. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/08/google-listen-podcast-manager-for.html">Listen</a>, Google's podcast manager app for Android, used Google Reader to store subscriptions.<br><br>8. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/10/feeds-for-google-alerts.html">Google Alerts</a> integrated with Google Reader, so you could subscribe to feeds instead of receiving email notofcations.<br><br>9. Back in 2008, Google's mobile transcoder displayed the site's feeds at the top of the page and <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/01/subscribe-to-feeds-in-google-reader.html">linked to Google Reader</a>.<br><br>10. Google Reader was the only Google product with <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/05/google-reader-optimized-for-wii.html">an interface optimized for Nintendo Wii</a>.<br><br>11. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/12/google-currents.html">Google Currents</a>, launched in 2011, allowed you to import your Google Reader subscriptions.<br><br>12. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/05/comment-on-any-google-reader-shared.html">Google Buzz's commenting feature</a> was integrated with Google Reader.<br><br><br><br>13. When Bloglines was discontinued in 2010, Google Reader's team encouraged users to <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2010/09/welcome-and-look-back.html">switch to Reader</a>. The blog post includes a graph of Reader users over time.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br>14. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/12/google-groups-tests-new-interface.html">The Google Groups redesign</a> from 2010 was inspired by Google Reader.<br><br>15. Google bought FeedBurner to monetize Google Reader and launched <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/08/google-tests-adsense-for-feeds.html">AdSense for Feeds</a>.<br><br>16. Back in 2007, Google Reader made shared items available to <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/12/google-reader-shows-shared-items-from.html">Google Talk contacts</a> and many people complained about this.<br><br>17. <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/follow-what-obama-mccain-and-leading.html">Google's Power Readers</a> feature from 2008 allowed you to "track the news sites and blogs Barack Obama and John McCain read" using Google Reader. It was a clever way to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10019668-38.html">promote Google Reader.</a> This feature <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/finding-great-stuff-to-read-with-google.html">was expanded</a> to "include journalists, techies, fashion critics, foodies and more".<br><br>18. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/03/add-feeds-to-google-reader-in-internet.html">Google Toolbar for IE</a> allowed you to subscribe to feeds using iGoogle or Google Reader.<br><br>19. Google Blog Search still has this link below the list of search results page: "Subscribe to a blog search feed for [query] in Google Reader". Google News had <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-news-gains-subscribe-to-google-reader-link-10994">a similar link</a>.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br>20. Google Spreadsheets has <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/09/google-spreadsheets-lets-you-import.html">a special function for importing feeds</a> that was initially called GoogleReader. Now it's called <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/table/25273?hl=en">ImportFeed</a>.<br><br>21. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/10/google-tv-queue.html">Google TV Queue</a> uses Google Reader to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/androinica.com/2011/01/google-tv-queue-sync-with-google-reade/">manage subscriptions</a>.<br><br>22. Google Reader was Google's infrastructure for feeds and the technology was used by iGoogle, orkut, Gmail's web clips, Blogger widgets, Google Spreadsheets and the Ajax API.<br><br>I'm sure you can find other examples of services that integrated with Google Reader. I didn't include all the third-party apps and services that used the unofficial Google Reader API. As you can see, Reader was an important part of the Google ecosystem and Google did promote the service in many ways.<div class="feedflare">

        <p>With the new <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/06/finally-elementary-tweaks.html">elementary-tweaks</a>, you may be looking to mix things up a bit on your elementary desktop. Here are two promising icon themes in progress that you should keep your eye on.<br><br>

<h4>Tap Revival</h4>
<a href="http://spiceofdesign.deviantart.com/">~spiceofdesign</a> is back at it again, this time with a <a href="http://spiceofdesign.deviantart.com/art/Tap-Revival-377732196">new icon set</a>. And it's beautiful.<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hliQDczMN18/UcNph-hA1YI/AAAAAAAAB68/1F8ZfavwjoA/s1600/tap_revival_by_spiceofdesign-d68w410.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a></div><br>
We love the flat feel and the consistent look. It feels right at home in elementary luna.<br>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FoEGvF1W_4I/UcNpW6R9BsI/AAAAAAAAB60/kpSEXBpf3ys/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-06-20+13:34:27.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a></div><br><br>

<h4>Google Services Icons</h4>
<a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/search/?q=TraumaD91&x=-1104&y=-330">TraumaD91</a> is also back! His <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/art/Google-Services-Icons-370887013">Google icon set</a> continues to expand in scope while retaining its beauty.<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DywnrgXMfSQ/UcNriMoQdFI/AAAAAAAAB7U/V7vg4XuOADo/s1600/google_services_icons_by_traumad91-d64te91.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a></div>

<p>Network play, custom graphics, two game styles and adjustable controls.</p>
<p>High scores rankings, simultaneous two-player action and more options than you can shake a stick at.</p>
<p>And, it&#8217;s got color.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see vitetris in many distros save <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vitetris/" target="_blank">AUR</a>, which shouldn&#8217;t deter you from building this yourself. It&#8217;s definitely worth the trouble.</p>

  <p>A self-professed Xbox engineer has taken to Pastebin to <a href="http://pastebin.com/TE1MWES2" target="_blank">share his thoughts</a> on Microsoft's recent <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4445984/xbox-one-policy-reversal-changes">Xbox One policy changes</a>. Describing the backlash around the Xbox One's online requirement and used game policies, the engineer says "I feel that if we spent less time on them, and more time explaining the great features we had lined up and the ones in the pipes, gamers and media alike would have aligned to our vision." Microsoft's first official comment on its online plans and used game policies caused <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/22/4354796/xbox-one-always-online-requirement-used-games-confusion">initial confusion thanks to contradictory statements</a>, but the company eventually<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/6/4403936/xbox-one-online-requirements-details"> detailed the policies fully</a>. Earlier this week, Microsoft was forced to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4445984/xbox-one-policy-reversal-changes">change its policies</a>, following criticism that made it <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4444338/playstation-4-xbox-one-late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-used-games-drm-online-requirement">into the mainstream</a>.

  <p>HTC cut total executive salaries, bonuses, and retirement pay in half last year, following poor financial results and lower-than-expected smartphone sales. In its annual report published today, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20130621-700767.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" target="_blank">spotted by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i></a>, HTC said it paid its top executives NT$660.5 million ($21.94 million) in 2012, down 51.4 percent from NT$1.36 billion ($45.18 million) in 2011. As the Taiwanese smartphone maker reduced costs, HTC CEO Peter Chou and president of engineering Fred Lui both saw their total compensation fall below NT$100 million ($3.3 million) for the first time in two years.</p>

  <p>Over the past year, Fujifilm&rsquo;s X series of compact cameras have won a lot of converts, and today we&rsquo;re seeing the first leaked images of the X-M1, its first entry-level interchangeable lens body in the range. <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=en&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http://digicame-info.com/2013/06/x-m1xf16-50mm-f35-56-ois.html&usg=ALkJrhgBQO4tniHMN45uh_C-i30jL2Eccg" target="_blank">Posted by <em>Digicame Info</em></a>, the images show the same trademark faux leather and brushed metal retro styling found on the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/6/3294234/fujifilm-x-e1">X-E1</a>, ditching the electronic viewfinder, but keeping the same pop-up flash and hotshoe found on its more expensive sibling. Judging from the photos, it also adds a tilting LCD and Wi-Fi connectivity. But where the X-E1 favored direct control over shutter speed and exposure compensation, the X-M1 re-maps the dual control dials to a mode selector and what appears to be a general purpose scroll wheel. It looks like...</p>

  <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is preparing to loosen current restrictions on the use of personal electronics on planes, more than year after the agency <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/18/2882745/faa-electronic-devices-ban-getting-a-fresh-look">announced plans</a> to reconsider its gadget ban. According to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323300004578557683978941640.html" target="_blank"><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a>, a 28-member advisory panel will recommend that the FAA relax its restrictions during taxiing, takeoff, and landing, as part of an investigation <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/27/3272452/faa-industry-working-group-study-electronics-planes">launched last August</a>. Under current regulations &mdash; which have remained unchanged since 1966 &mdash; airlines ban the use of all devices until planes reach an altitude of 10,000 feet.</p>
<p>The panel's draft has yet to be finalized, and details are still under debate, but the report makes clear that existing regulations "have become untenable." If the FAA agrees to...</p>

  <p>Following nearly three weeks of arguments from Apple and the Department of Justice, the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/3/4392874/apple-doj-ebook-trial">trial around ebook price fixing</a> wrapped up today with the presentation of closing arguments. Both sides have released their closing slide decks, <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130620/heres-apples-closing-slide-deck-in-e-book-case-and-the-dojs-too/" target="_blank">posted by <em>All Things D</em></a><em>,</em> trying to drive home the same lines of argument we&rsquo;ve seen throughout the trial. While Apple is arguing that the ebook business was in turmoil with publishers looking to escape Amazon&rsquo;s loss-leading business practices, the government is arguing that Apple was the ringleader in a scheme to raise ebook prices across the board. You can take a look at the full decks below.</p>

  <p>Documents <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-without-warrant" target="_blank">obtained by the <i>Guardian</i></a> have revealed for the first time the top secret procedures detailing how the US National Security Agency can gather and use surveillance data. The guidelines, which were approved by the secret FISA court and Attorney General Eric Holder on the 29th of July, 2009, show that while the NSA is required to "minimize" the collection of data suspected to belong to US citizens, "inadvertently acquired" domestic communications can still be kept under certain circumstances without a warrant.</p>
<p>As US officials have previously stated, NSA analysts are only allowed to specifically target "non-US persons," and must take steps to prevent US citizens located within the US from being caught in their nets. That includes...</p>

  <p>HTC is preparing an extensive two-year marketing campaign featuring <i>Iron Man</i> star Robert Downey Jr, according to two sources who spoke to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-20/htc-said-to-hire-robert-downey-jr-for-12-million-ad-campaign.html" target="_blank"><i>Bloomberg</i></a>. The deal is said to be worth $12 million and will span television, print, and billboard advertising around the globe, with Downey maintaining a level of creative control.</p>
<p>HTC has struggled to keep the pace with rival Samsung's marketing muscle, despite <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/8/4196446/htc-one-att-lte-review">positive reviews</a> of products such as the flagship One smartphone, and was also recently hit with a series of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4352838/htc-in-disarray-kouji-kodera-staff-departures-disastrous-first-and-production-problems">high-profile departures</a>. The company said last month it had sold <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4358378/htc-one-5-million-smartphone-sales">around five million One phones</a> since its March launch, compared to Samsung's <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/22/4357732/samsung-galaxy-s4-hits-10-million-units-shipped">10 million shipments of the Galaxy S4</a> in its first month.</p>

        <p class="itembyline">
        by Dinsan Francis
        in <a href="http://www.chromestory.com">Chrome Story</a>

    <div class="itemdescription" id="itemhttp://www.chromestory.com/?p=8848">
        <p>This post is from <a href="http://www.chromestory.com">Chrome Story - The Best Chromebook Resource on The Planet!</a></p><p>Another question asked by new Chromebook owners. Can I use iTunes on my Chromebook? How do I install iTunes on Chrome OS? Short answer? NO. Long answer? Nooooooooooooooooooooo (saw that on a Verge article, cool uh?)</p>
<p>Your Chromebook cannot run traditional software. <a href="http://www.chromestory.com/2013/06/how-do-i-install-software-programs-on-my-chromebook/" title="How do I Install Software / Programs on My Chromebook?">Chrome OS runs web apps and packaged apps</a>. So you cannot use iTunes but there are other ways of playing music. Hundreds of them.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: iTunes is a brilliant app and eco system. All I am trying to do here is, suggest some alternatives, so that you will enjoy your Chromebook a little more.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Chrome OS Music Player</h3>
<p>Chrome OS <a href="http://www.chromestory.com/2013/02/using-google-chrome-os-file-manager/" title="Using Google Chrome OS File Manager">Files app</a> has a music player that can play songs that you have downloaded or copied to your Chromebook. The following media file types are supported.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.3gp</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.avi</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.mov</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.mp4</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.m4v</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.m4a</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.mp3</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.ogv</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.ogm</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.ogg</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.oga</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.webm</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.wav</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These files can be opened from the Files app (not from the browser) and the inbuilt media player will open up to play your file.</p>
<h3>Google Music</h3>
<p>Google Music is Google&#8217;s iTunes, just that it runs mostly from your browser, streaming music to your computers and phones. You can consider <strong>Google Play Music</strong> if you are interested in switching camps  </p>
<p>There is a workaround to access your iTunes library from a Chromebook. <a href="http://www.chromestory.com/2012/10/how-to-access-your-itunes-music-library-on-your-chromebook/" target="_blank" title="iTunes on Chromebook">Read here</a>.</p>
<p>You can remotely access your Windows PC or Macbook using Chrome&#8217;s remote desktop feature and connect iTunes from there too.</p>
<h3>Other Cloud Music Services</h3>
<p>There are dozens of free and paid music streaming and online radio services available on the web. Spotify and Pandora are couple of examples. But I am sure you guys don&#8217;t need someone telling you about these services, thanks to their popularity.</p>

  <p>I am a professional commercial photographer. I have been for the last 25 years.</p>

<p>Throughout most of my career, I&rsquo;ve had a hard time taking personal pictures &mdash; and for years I thought that shooting film was to blame.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always found shooting film nerve-wracking. The joy of the &ldquo;latent image&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t quite so joyous when you&rsquo;re wondering if the shots are actually going to come out. And it got steadily worse: The more experienced I became, the more I realized what could go wrong. The nerves were always there &mdash; occasionally with very good reason. The biggest thrill I got from a roll of processed film was the thrill of relief.</p>

  <p>At an event at its Menlo Park headquarters on Thursday, Facebook <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/53448889009/video-on-instagram" target="_blank">announced</a> Video on Instagram for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8" target="_blank">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android&hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a>, which lets you shoot 15-second videos, apply filters, and share them to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and other sites.</p>
<p>Shooting an Instagram video is quite a bit more complex than taking an Instagram photo. It all starts with the camera button, but instead of taking a photo, you tap a video button off to the right side. From here, you hold down the shutter button to start shooting video. You can pick up your finger to stop shooting, then tap and hold the shutter button to start shooting video again, just like on Vine. If you're not happy with the shot you just took, a conveniently placed delete button lets you backtrack and...</p>

  <p>To go along with the slew of new products Samsung is announcing today, the company also took a few moments to tout its flagship Galaxy S4 smartphone. Samsung also took a moment to introduce the phone in a number of new colors, much as it did <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/28/3273823/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-colors-inspired-by-nature">last summer for the Galaxy S III</a>. As shown on stage, the five new colors are blue, purple, red, brown, and pink &mdash; each with an appropriately goofy adjective added on for good measure. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/22/4357732/samsung-galaxy-s4-hits-10-million-units-shipped">Samsung first announced</a> that it would be bringing new colors out last month when it trumpeted Galaxy S4 sales of 10 million, but unfortunately it didn't say when or where these new colors would be available. If last year was any indication, we'd expect international territories to get them first, with different colors...</p>

  <p>At its Galaxy &amp; ATIV event in London, Samsung announced new ATIV Book 9 Plus and  ATIV Book 9 Lite ultrabooks. Early leaks suggest the ATIV Book 9 Plus offers a 13.3-inch 3200 x 1800 qHD+<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>multitouch display and is powered by an Intel Core i5-4200U (Haswell) processor, which offers a full 12 hours battery life. It's 13.6mm at its widest point and weights just 1.39kg. The Book 9 Lite features the same display technology as its counterpart but is powered by an AMD A6 quad-core chip. Both ultrabooks include 4GB RAM, a 128GB SSD, and feature Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system. The company will also bundle its new SideSync software, allowing users to drag and drop file transfers between smartphone and the ATIV.</p>

  <p>Samsung's famous for launching every type of device under the sun, but this time it's crammed them all into a single package. The company's just announced the Ativ Q, a dual-booting device that runs both Windows 8 and Android inside a convertible laptop package. The most impressive parts of the hardware are the insanely high-res 3200 x 1800 screen &mdash; the first use of the new display Samsung <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/20/4347540/samsung-qhd-high-resolution-ultrabook-display">announced in May</a> &mdash; that is also designed to be used outdoors, and "even in very bright sunlight." It also has a flexible hinge that allows the Q to work in tablet mode, laptop mode, stand mode, and a sort of floating mode. From a hardware standpoint, the magnesium device looks remarkably similar to the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.theverge.com/products/brands/acer/4">Acer</a> <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.theverge.com/products/aspire-r7/7004">Aspire R7</a>, though at .55 inches and 2.84...</p>

  <p>Samsung has just announced the Galaxy NX, its latest interchangeable lens camera. The Galaxy NX is unique compared to the rest of Samsung's NX line in that it is powered by Android &mdash; much in the same way the company's Galaxy Camera and Galaxy S4 Zoom are.</p>
<p>The Galaxy NX looks very similar to Samsung's prior NX models, save for the giant 4.8-inch HD touchscreen display grafted to the back of it. Essentially, the NX is the love-child of a Galaxy S3 smartphone and NX20 camera &mdash; it's powered by a 1.6GHz quad-core processor, runs Android 4.2.2, and features an APS-C class 20.3-megapixel image sensor. It has full compatibility with Samsung's growing line of interchangeable lenses &mdash; including the new 3D lenses. It has 16GB of internal...</p>

  <p>To some, Apple TV seems like a laggard.</p>
<p>The web TV box that Apple has referred to for years as a "hobby" is only now <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4444814/apple-tv-adds-hbo-go-watchespn-others">offering access to shows and events from HBO and ESPN</a> &mdash; long after Roku and Xbox. The truth, however, is that the process of acquiring and delivering episodes of <em>True Blood</em> and <em>SportsCenter</em> isn't as easy as flicking a switch.   </p>

  <p>Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom has just taken the stage at a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/14/4431012/facebook-hosting-june-20th-event-big-ideas">Facebook event today</a> and shared some details on the photo-sharing service's user engagement. The service now has 130 million active monthly users, up from the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2946602/instagram-40-million-users/in/2687603">40 million users</a> that the service had when it launched on Android last April. Systrom also said that Instagram users have shared over 16 billion pictures since it launched about two and a half years ago, and its users register 1 billion "likes" every day. Of course, that's not enough for Instagram &mdash; the company hopes it'll increase engagement even more with its brand-new <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/20/4448182/facebook">video sharing feature</a>.</p>

  <p>Facebook today announced <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/53448889009/video-on-instagram" target="_blank">video for Instagram</a>, saying it aimed to make video as easy to create and share as possible. The overall look and feel of the updated app are the same, but next to the main capture icon is now a video camera icon. The user taps the button to begin recording up to 15 seconds of video, and when published it appeared in the main Instagram feed. The updated app is available now on both <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/vine">Twitter's Vine app</a>, which the video feature closely resembles, Instagram video contains a delete button. Tapping it will eliminate the most recently recorded segment. As you might expect with Instagram, the app includes filters: 13 of them to start, created with the help of a video artist, the company said.</p>

  <p>In November of 2014, if all goes according to plan, NASA's <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/solarsail/solarsail_overview.html" target="_blank">Sunjammer</a> will be launched into space. Engineers will pack a waist-high shell with a compact probe and a 13,000 square foot solar sail &mdash; the largest ever built. Once in orbit, the sail will unfurl, catch the energy of solar wind &mdash; essentially a stream of charged particles &mdash; and gently pull the craft towards the Sun.</p>
<p>The Sunjammer will also carry the cremated remains of a few hundred wealthy Earthlings, stowed in metal discs that serve as ballast for the craft and protect it by absorbing solar radiation. Paid submissions of text, photos, sounds, and video from thousands more &mdash; profound thoughts, surely, but probably also memes, pet photos and YouTube clips &mdash; will fill...</p>

        <div>
<p>A local shop is part of an ecosystem &#8212; here in England we call it the High Street. The owner of a local shop generally has no ambition to become a Tesco or WalMart. She&#8217;d rather experience steady growth, building relationships with customers who value what she brings to the community.</p>

<p>People often mourn the disappearance of their &#8220;local shops.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure it is the same in many parts of the world. Large chains move in, and the small local businesses, unable to compete on price, close. As the local shops disappear, customers win on price, but they are losing on personal service.</p>
<p>At local shops, they know their customers by name, remember the usual order of a familiar face, are happy to go the extra mile for a customer who will come through the door every week. It&#8217;s most often the business owner who is behind the counter filling bags and taking money.</p>
<p>This direct and personal relationship with the people that their business serves quite naturally provides the local shop with information to meet the needs of their customers. Customers come in and ask if they stock a certain product, one that they have seen advertised on TV; or that is required for a recipe on a recent episode of a cooking show. The local shop owner remembers that three people asked for that same thing this week, and adds it to their order. We&#8217;re not dealing with the careful analysis of data collected from thousands of customers here. The shop owner could name the customers that asked for that item &#8212; she will point out the new stock to them next time they come in.</p>
<p>One single store is unlikely to attract much footfall, so the business of one store relies on being part of a vibrant community. Within this community the local shops and tradespeople support each other. A customer pops into a store and mentions while paying that they are having trouble with their car; the shopkeeper recommends the garage down the road &#8212; &#8220;don&#8217;t forget to tell Jim that I sent you!&#8221;</p>
<p>As the co-owner of a bootstrapped digital product, I often feel like we are that local shop on the web. I know many of our customers by name, I know the sort of projects they use our software for. I follow many of them from my personal account on Twitter. I love the fact that they come to speak to me at conferences; that they feel they know us, Drew and Rachel from Perch. This familiarity means they tell us their ideas for the product, and share with us their frustrations in their work. We love being able to tell someone we&#8217;ve implemented their suggestions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also part of this ecosystem of small products. Unlike the village shops we are not bound together by location, but I think we are bound together by ethos. When selecting a tool or product to use in our business, I always prefer those by similar small businesses. I feel I can trust that the founders will know us by name, will care about our individual experience with their product. When I get in touch with a query I want to feel as if my issue is truly important to them, perhaps get a personal response from the founder rather than a cheery support representative quoting from a script.</p>
<p>This is business. We make a thing, and we sell it at a profit. The money we make enables us to continue to create something that people want, and to support our customers as they use our product. It also enables us to support other people who are running businesses in this digital high street we are part of, from the companies who provide the software we use for our help desk and our bug tracking system, right through to the freelancers who design for us.</p>
<p>I am happy with my small shopkeeper status. I talk and write about bootstrapping because I want to show other developers that there is a sane and achievable route to launching a product, a route that doesn&#8217;t involve chasing funding rounds or becoming beholden to a board of investors. I love the fact that decisions for my product can be made by the two of us, based on the discussions we have with our customers. If we had investors hoping for a return on their investment, it would be a very different product by now, and I don&#8217;t think a better one.</p>
<p>I think it is important for those of us succeeding at this to talk about it. As an industry we make a lot of noise about the startup that has just landed a huge funding round. We then bemoan the disappearance of products that we use and love, when the founder sells out to a Yahoo!, Twitter, or Google. Yet we don&#8217;t always make the connection between the two.</p>
<p>Small sustainable businesses rarely make headlines. So we, the local shopkeepers and tradespeople of the web, need to celebrate our own successes, build each other up, and support each other. I&#8217;d love there to be more ways to highlight the amazing products and services out there that are developed by individuals and tiny teams, to celebrate the local shops of the web. Let&#8217;s support those people who are crafting small, sustainable businesses&#8212;he people who know their customers and are not interested in chasing a lottery-winning dream of acquisition, but instead are happy to make a living making a good thing that other people love.</p>

<p>We hear it mostly from proud CEOs and recruiters, as a sweet nothing designed to tempt candidates to drop their counter-offers, or a statement in a desperate pitch deck. We&#8217;re changing the world! All it takes is a few hundred fearsome intellects and laptops. Are you in or out?</p>

  <p>Games like <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/10/4085928/the-classics-everyday-shooter"><i>Everyday Shooter</i></a> and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/22/3901268/wave-trip-musical-iphone-ipad-game"><i>Wave Trip</i></a> have you creating music through gameplay, but <em>Soundodger</em> goes in the opposite direction &mdash; the goal is to avoid the music. You play as a tiny circle, and as the music starts to play little triangles will start firing in your direction like missiles in time to the beat. Avoiding them is incredibly simple: All you need to do is move the mouse cursor to get out of the way. You also have the ability to slow down time when things get particularly hectic. You can't actually lose in <em>Soundodger</em> &mdash; messing up will simply rewind the track briefly &mdash; but getting a 100 percent score can be a challenge, especially on some of the tougher levels.</p>
<p>The simple, minimalist visual style really helps you get into...</p>

  <p>Betaworks, the New York-based startup factory founded in 2007, is having a good run. In the last year it took over and reinvigorated the ailing social new service, Digg; launched a chart-topping iOS game called <em>Dots;</em> and saw Tumblr, in which it was an early investor, sell for more than a billion dollars. It&rsquo;s a tryptych that nicely illustrates the company&rsquo;s unique strategy: build, buy and invest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been difficult to put a label on <a href="http://betaworks.com/" target="new">Betaworks</a>. It&rsquo;s been called an idea lab, a digital studio and a "company that builds companies." It goes out of its way to declare that it's not a startup incubator like Y Combinator or a traditional venture capital fund. Whatever the moniker, the model it&rsquo;s developed &mdash; fast, agile, and...</p>

  <p>Dropbox and Google Drive work quite well for sharing files with friends and family, but a whole other genre of apps exist for people who need to share files even faster. <a href="http://getcloudapp.com/" target="_blank">CloudApp</a> and <a href="https://droplr.com/hello" target="_blank">Droplr</a> are two notable entries, which let you share files by dragging them into a menu bar app, at which point a URL is dropped into your clipboard for sharing. The latest app to join the fray is <a href="https://cloudup.com/" target="_blank">Cloudup</a>, a design-focused and dead-simple take on file sharing launching Thursday for Mac, and for web on desktop and mobile.</p>

  <p>Since its unveiling at CES 2013, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/14/4329008/nvidia-shield-price-specs-release-date-preorders-begin-hands-on-preview">Nvidia's Shield portable console</a> has undergone quite a few revisions. When the company put its Tegra 4-powered Android device in gamers' hands at PAX East in March, it found enough dissatisfaction with its ergonomics to perform a significant physical redesign. Since then, Shield demo units have toured the globe, from Computex in Taipei to E3 in LA, and now Nvidia's addressing the other major concern expressed by those who've tried it: the price.</p>
<p>Shield <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/17/4339618/nvidia-shield-android-console-pre-order-release-date">pre-orders began at $349</a> roughly a month ago, but Nvidia's slashing that cost to $299 and officially confirming June 27th as the release date for its clamshell console. Anyone who's already put in a pre-order will be charged the lower price. Back at...</p>

        <p>Times are tough for us post graduates. I just graduated in May and I&#8217;m still trying to find a job. I&#8217;m in the phase of job searching where I don&#8217;t even care what I do, just as long as I get job. I&#8217;ll mow lawns if needed. Just let me work for you! With that being said, I never even thought about employee happiness until I read this infographic, I just figured if I got a job I&#8217;d be happy. But turns out, that isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>According to today&#8217;s infographic, employee happiness affects the productivity of the workplace, and the overall feelings that employees have about their work. Fixing issues that make employees unhappy can turn the productivity of a workplace around, and can ultimately save a doomed business. When looking for jobs, I will definitely look at the environment of my future employers to see if it is a place that I will feel happy in. I think it will be a step that will positively impact my first big girl job. I encourage you readers talk to your employers to find new ways to make your place of work a more happy and enjoyable place to work!

  <p>"We&rsquo;re the kings of 2007!" said Andrew McLaughlin, CEO of Digg, as we opened beers on a Friday afternoon in the Digg-anchored corner of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/20/4447920/betaworks-a-startup-studio-doubles-down-on-creating-a-company-of">Betaworks, the high-ceilinged West Village startup incubator</a> where attempts are underway to revive a brand that peaked more than five years ago.</p>
<p>McLaughlin is part of the small team that bought and relaunched the news aggregator <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/1/3212627/digg-relaunch-betaworks-video">nine months ago</a> in an effort to recapture some of the influence Digg had in its heyday. There was some ribbing, including unflattering comparisons to MySpace and disparaging comparisons to former Digg competitor Reddit, which is having an unprecedented impact on politics and culture. "Can Digg be revived? Short answer: No. Long Answer: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo-...</p>

  <p>Adobe's <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/18/4441066/adobe-photoshop-cc-hands-on-camera-shake-enlargements">new cloud-integrated image editing application Photoshop CC</a> has been pirated within a day of its release. Photoshop CC represents a big step away from standalone software for Adobe, and is only available through a monthly or annual subscription. <a href="http://petapixel.com/2013/06/19/adobe-photoshop-cc-has-apparently-been-cracked-one-day-after-launch/" target="_blank">As<i> Fstoppers</i> reports</a>, pirated copies of the software are being shared through BitTorrent and don't require authentication with Adobe's servers. Photoshop CC was cracked in much the same way as previous versions of Photoshop, and the pirated application takes advantage of the software's offline mode, which only checks in with Adobe's servers once a month.</p>

  <p>A little under three years ago, <i>New York Magazine</i>'s Graeme Wood discovered that his old classmate Samuel Phineas Upham had been arrested for attempting to cheat the IRS. The arrest led a three-year suspended sentence, but the story was covered by a number of publications, resulting in Upham's name being followed by "tax," "arrested," and "indictment" in Google's autocomplete results. Intrigued by his ex-classmate's plight, Wood set up news alerts to inform him of developments, and soon discovered that Upham was engaging in a number of philanthropic activities. All was not what it seemed, however, as the new stories and search results turned out to be false.

Should Google fail to make changes within three months, it would face an initial fine of up to &euro;150,000 (about $198,300), and a second fine of up to &euro;300,000 ($396,500) if the search company continues to neglect the CNIL's orders.</p>

  <p>The line between mobile and console gaming gets blurrier as time goes by, and today's release of <i>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</i> for iOS is one of the more compelling pieces of evidence to date. It's nothing less than a full port of the well-received turn-based strategy title that 2K Games brought to to PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 last year, and that <a href="http://www.polygon.com/game/xcom-enemy-unknown/2731" target="_blank"><i>Polygon</i> gave 8.5 out of 10</a>.</p>

        <p class="itembyline">

        in <a href="http://archlinux.me">Arch Linux User Blogs</a>
        
    </div>
    <div class="itemdescription" id="itemhttp://archlinux.me/dusty/2013/06/19/creating-an-application-in-kivy-part-2/">
        <p>This article continues the tutorial we started in <a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/2013/06/13/creating-an-application-in-kivy-part-1/">Part 1</a>. In the first part, we set up a Kivy project and developed a very basic Kivy application. We also discussed version control to aid in project management. In this part, we&#8217;ll be designing an actual user interface for a Jabber client and begin to implement it in the KV language.</p>
<p>Make sure you have completed part 1, or if you want to skip the preliminaries, you can clone the <a href="https://github.com/buchuki/orkiv/tree/end_part_one">end_part_one</a> tag of the <a href="https://github.com/buchuki/orkiv">Orkiv git repository</a> and start from there. It&#8217;s probably a good idea to name a new branch for your working changes so your master branch doesn&#8217;t diverge from my upstream repository. Remember to activate the virtualenv you created in Part 1 (or create one if you&#8217;re starting from the git clone.)</p>
<pre class="brush:bash">
git clone https://github.com/buchuki/orkiv.git
git checkout end_part_one
git checkout -b working_changes
source venv/bin/activate
</pre>

<p>Here are links to other parts of the tutorial. I&#8217;m sorry for the navigation faux pas; blogs are not the best interface for multi-part articles.</p>

<li><a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/2013/06/19/creating-an-application-in-kivy-part-2/">Part 2: Creating a form</a></li>
</ol>
<h4>Interface Design</h4>
<p>In general, before developing a user interface, it is a good idea to know what you want it to look like. I see this project having three main views. When the user first opens the application, they&#8217;ll see an <em>Account Details</em> screen to provide their jabber server and login credentials. We won&#8217;t bother with saving these details since this tutorial series is focused on Kivy interface development, not persistence. Once they have logged in, the other two views are a <em>Buddy List</em> and the individual <em>Chat Window</em>.</p>
<p>I would like to develop the app to show the buddy list and chat windows side by side if the screen is large enough (eg: a laptop screen or large tablet in horizontal orientation), but only one window at a time on small screens. It is very important to evaluate screen size when developing cross platform applications; it is generally not desirable or feasible to render the same view on large monitors and small phones. We&#8217;ll look at this feature in later tutorials, but knowing that we want to plan for it now will affect how we implement our design.</p>
<p>All of these windows are pretty simple. In this second part, we will focus on the account details screen. It will be a simple form with labels on the left and fields for entering the various details on the right. The fields covered will include server, username, and password. Below these fields will be a <em>Login</em> button. Normally I&#8217;d sketch the interface on a piece of paper, but since this looks like every other Jabber client on the market, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary.</p>
<h4>The Account Details Form Widget</h4>
<p>In Kivy, virtually every object that gets displayed on the screen is a widget. Just a few examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The label we rendered in the first tutorial</li>
<li>The text input fields and buttons we&#8217;ll render in this tutorial</li>
<li>Layout classes that contain other widgets and decide where they should be displayed</li>
<li>Complicated tree views such as file pickers</li>
<li>Movie and photo renderers</li>
<li>Tabbed boxes that display different widgets depending on the selected tab</li>
</ul>
<p>It is easy to make custom widgets, and to access all widgets, whether custom or otherwise, from KV language files. We&#8217;ll be creating a new widget to contain our entire <em>Account Details</em> form. Start by adding a new import and class to <code>__main__.py</code>:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="brush:python">
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout


class AccountDetailsForm(BoxLayout):
    pass
</pre>
<p>Running the code with this addition won&#8217;t change anything in the output, since the newly created widget hasn&#8217;t been added to the root window. However, there are a few things we need to discuss before we change the KV language file to use this widget. You might be asking yourself why we created a new widget instead of adding a <code>BoxLayout</code> widget (whatever that is!) directly to the root of the KV language file <code>orkiv.kv</code>. While it would have been trivial to do this, it would have made putting a new widget (such as the Buddy List) on the root screen more difficult. Further, when it comes time to attach events to the Login button, we can make it a method of this new class, where it makes the most sense.</p>
<p>The <code>BoxLayout</code> is a very simple widget that simply takes the available space and places all the child widgets in it from left to right or top to bottom. By default, each widget gets an equal amount of space, but it&#8217;s also possible to make certain widgets have specific sizes or percentages of space or to expand to fill available area.</p>
<p><code>BoxLayout</code> is one of several kinds of layouts available in Kivy. A layout is simply a container widget that holds other widgets and knows how to position those child widgets in a specific pattern. We&#8217;ll be seeing a <code>GridLayout</code> shortly. You can read about other Kivy layouts in the <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.layout.html?highlight=layout#kivy.uix.layout">Kivy API Reference</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s edit <code>orkiv.kv</code> to render this new widget as the child form instead of the label we used before. We&#8217;ll also add a couple labels to the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> class so you can see the relationship between root widgets and classes in the KV Language:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="brush:python">
AccountDetailsForm:

&lt;AccountDetailsForm&gt;:
    Label: 
        text: 'Hello World'
    Label:
        text: 'Another World'
</pre>
<p>There&#8217;s a couple things going on here. The root widget of the <code>Orkiv</code> app is defined as a <code>AccountDetailsForm</code>. This is followed by a colon in case we wanted to add other child widgets to the object, but in this case, it&#8217;s just followed by a blank line. Then we define the structure of the child widgets of the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> class itself. We know it&#8217;s a class and not a root widget because the class name is surrounded in angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;). Further, one app can only have one root widget. We just defined that root to be pointing at a single <code>AccountDetailsForm</code>. However, note that a class can be styled once and added in more than one place. Just as our <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> has two labels, it would be possible (though silly, from an interface perspective) to create a container widget that contains two <code>AccountDetailsForm</code>s. The point is, an <code>AccountDetailsForm</code>, once its layout has been defined, can be used just like any of the built-in widgets supplied with Kivy.</p>
<p>If you run <code>python orkiv</code> now, it will render the two labels side by side, each taking a full half the window. Note that there are actually three widgets being rendered; first, the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> (which <em>is a</em> <code>BoxLayout</code> by inheritance) is rendered to fill the whole screen, and then it lays out the two labels as child widgets.</p>
<p>However, that&#8217;s not the AccountDetailsForm we were looking for! Let&#8217;s create our first nontrivial Kivy Language class. Replace the <code></code> class in your <code>orkiv.kv</code> with the following:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="brush:python">
&lt;AccountDetailsForm&gt;:
    orientation: "vertical"
    GridLayout:
        cols: 2
        Label:
            text: "Server"
        TextInput:
        Label:
            text: "Username"
        TextInput:
        Label:
            text: "Password"
        TextInput:
            password: True
    Button:
        text: "Login"
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s time to discuss just how the Kivy language lays things out. In my mind, it uses a box model similar to HTML, except instead of ugly HTML tags, indentation is used to specify what widgets go inside other widgets. Also, unlike HTML, style information is included in the <code>.kv</code> file instead of an external <code>.css</code> file. Though it&#8217;s not a hard and fast rule, style information (called properties in Kivy) typically begins with a lowercase letter, while child widgets start with a capital.</p>
<p>Look at the first level of indentation under the <code>&lt;AccountDetailsForm&gt;</code> declaration. There are three items; <code>orientation</code>, <code>GridLayout</code>, and <code>Button</code>. The former counts as &#8220;style information&#8221;. Remember that the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> class extends <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.boxlayout.html#kivy.uix.boxlayout.BoxLayout">BoxLayout</a>. One of the attributes on BoxLayout is &#8220;orientation&#8221;; we are telling BoxLayout here that we want a vertical layout.</p>
<p>This vertical box layout then contains two widgets, a <code>GridLayout</code> and a <code>Button</code>. The <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.gridlayout.html#kivy.uix.gridlayout.GridLayout">GridLayout</a> spaces all it&#8217;s children equally. We just have to tell it that there are 2 columns (the <code>cols</code> property) and then start adding our objects, which are displayed from left to right and wrap to the next row in the grid after every two widgets. We add <code>Label</code>s and <code>TextInput</code>s. Each label has a <code>text</code> property that we set using a further level of indent. The <code>TextInput</code> objects don&#8217;t require any extra properties except the password.</p>
<p>Later, we&#8217;ll have to give these objects some identifiers so we can refer to them in code. For this initial prototyping stage, we can start with the bare minimum. If we render the above example, we end up with a recognizable, but rather ugly form:</p>
<p><a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/files/2013/06/example_6.png"></a></p>
<h4>Restricting sizes</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s try to make the form a little less ugly:</p>
<pre class="brush:python">
&lt;AccountDetailsForm&gt;:
    orientation: "vertical"
    height: "200dp"
    size_hint_y: None
    GridLayout:
        cols: 2
        row_default_height: "40dp"
        row_force_default: True
        spacing: "10dp"
        padding: "10dp"
        Label:
            text: "Server"
        TextInput:
        Label:
            text: "Username"
        TextInput:
        Label:
            text: "Password"
        TextInput:
            password: True
    Button:
        size_hint_y: None
        height: "40dp"
        text: "Login"
</pre>
<p>All we&#8217;ve done here is add some styling information to make the layout a little more friendly. This can be complicated as we want the app to look good on a variety of devices at a variety of resolutions and screen sizes. The main thing is to ensure all the widgets have a known height. As you might guess, this can be accomplished by adding a <code>height</code> property to each of the widgets. However, doing this alone will not work because <code>BoxLayout</code> likes to think of itself as in charge of deciding what size a widget should be. Without any styling, heights in a vertical <code>BoxLayout</code> are calculated as the number of widgets divided by the available screen space. However, it&#8217;s possible to tell <code>BoxLayout</code> to make certain widgets take a higher percentage of available space by giving it a <code>size_hint_y</code> attribute, which should be a float and defaults to 1.0. Unfortunately, for textboxes and buttons, percentages don&#8217;t really make a lot of sense, since we have no idea what size the window or screen of a particular advice is going to be, but we do know we want them to be about the same height on each screen.</p>
<p>So in addition to setting the <code>height</code> attribute, we also have to set <code>size_hint_y</code> to <code>None</code> for those widgets to prevent <code>BoxLayout</code> from ignoring the <code>height</code> property and laying things out by percentages instead.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also not that we are specifying the heights using strings that end in the suffix &#8220;dp&#8221;. It&#8217;s possible to provide integer values here, which would be interpreted as the number of pixels high the button is. However, due to the massive variance in screen resolutions on modern devices, it&#8217;s not really feasible to use pixels as a measurement. A login button that is 40 pixels high and looks good on a desktop monitor would look very small, indeed, on a &#8220;retina&#8221; display tablet.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kivy provides us with the concept of &#8220;display pixels&#8221;; hence the &#8220;dp&#8221; in the strings. Display pixels should be <em>about</em> the same size on every device; on a standard desktop monitor they generally map to a single pixel, but on higher density displays, they will be multiplied by a scaling factor. There are other <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.metrics.html">metric properties</a> such as <code>cm</code> or <code>in</code> that you can use, but I generally find it most convenient to think in display pixels.</p>
<p>Note also that instead of supplying heights for each of the <code>Label</code> and <code>TextInput</code> widgets inside the grid layout, we cheated and used the <code>row_default_height</code> attribute so all rows have the same height. For this to work, you also have to set <code>row_force_default</code> to True.</p>
<p>Finally we added <code>spacing</code> and <code>padding</code> properties to the <code>GridLayout</code> to add a 10dp space between child widgets and a &#8220;frame&#8221; around the whole <code>GridLayout</code> as well. If we run this example, it looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/files/2013/06/example_7.png"></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more thing I&#8217;d like to do before ending this part of the tutorial. As you can see above, the form is showing up at the bottom of the window, no matter what size the window is. That might look a bit bizarre on a tablet or even phone screen. It would be better if the entire form was anchored to the top of the window.</p>
<p>As an exercise, take a few moments to experiment (remember to use a different git branch!) and see if you can figure out how to move the form to the top by yourself. The next paragraph contains some hints if you get stuck, and the working code is linked after that. (I&#8217;m not about to tell you not to cheat, since it really depends what your personal goals are in reading this tutorial.)</p>
<p>There are probably multiple ways to do this, and I&#8217;m not even certain my solution is the best one. But I suggest making the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> into an <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.anchorlayout.html">AnchorLayout</a> and anchor a child <code>BoxLayout</code> to the top of the form. Note that you&#8217;ll have to change both files to make this happen.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still confused, have a look at the full changeset at <a href="https://github.com/buchuki/orkiv/commit/6a9a815f29e3913bb4cf38125e21416ad3c7770d">the changeset</a> on github.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for part 2 of this tutorial, which focused on laying out widgets in the KV Language. In part 3, we&#8217;ll figure out how to log into an XMPP library and render a buddy list. Note that I don&#8217;t actually know how to do this, so we&#8217;ll have to figure it out together!</p>

        <p>There's just one week and a half and Google Reader will be history. If you're using the service, it's a good idea to <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/#custom:reader">export your data</a> and switch to a different service. You can choose from <a href="http://www.feedly.com">Feedly</a>, <a href="http://www.theoldreader.com">The Old Reader</a>, <a href="http://www.multiplx.com/">MultiPLX</a>, <a href="http://www.feedspot.com/">Feedspot</a>, <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a>. I haven't decided which one I'll use, but Feedly is a strong contender.<br><br>Feedly is probably the service that will benefit the most from Google Reader's demise. It grew from 4 million users to 12 million users in only 3 months and that's impressive. The service was just a Google Reader client, an alternate interface for Google Reader that gained a foothold on mobile. <br><br>Feedly has recently started to migrate users from Google's backend to its own backend, while preserving most of their data. <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2013/06/19/feedly-cloud/">Feedly Cloud</a> was built in record time and it's now a scalable infrastructure for Feedly that can also be used by other apps that were powered by the unofficial Google Reader API. There are <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2013/06/19/feedly-cloud/">9 apps</a> that use it, including gReader, Newsify and Sprout Social. If you don't like the mobile apps or the browser extensions, there's now <a href="http://cloud.feedly.com/">a Feedly web app</a> that's optimized for the desktop and replaces extensions. It's hard to morph from a client to a platforms in a few months.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br>I'll miss Google Reader, like many other power users. Unfortunately for us, Google is not the right company for <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/01/google-and-niche-services.html">niche services</a>. Google wants to create products that are used by <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2013/06/google-stats.html">hundreds of million of users</a> and Google Reader wasn't one of them. Feedly and other similar services will have to find a business model for something that's no longer cool, no longer supported by many browsers, no longer supported by Twitter (other sites to follow). For many people, social sites offer better value than feed readers and not even Google could change that.<br><br>"As a culture we have moved into a realm where the consumption of news is a near-constant process. Users with smartphones and tablets are consuming news in bits and bites throughout the course of the day &#8212; replacing the old standard behaviors of news consumption over breakfast along with a leisurely read at the end of the day. (...) Google is looking at pervasive means to surface news across products to address each user's interest with the right information at the right time via the most appropriate means," <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/06/why-google-reader-got-the-ax/">said Richard Gingras</a>, Senior Director, News & Social Products at Google.<br><br>So what will you use instead of Google Reader?<div class="feedflare">

        <p>While elementaryOS is certainly great out-of-the-box, users have and will always tweak it to their preferences. <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/05/welcome-to-elementary-os.html">We have posted a lot of How-To articles</a> that let you delve deep into the system and <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/06/install-and-use-indicator-synapse.html">add new functionality</a>, <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/04/top-5-plank-themes.html">change appearances</a> and so forth.<br>

<br>
<br>
A tool similar to <a href="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool">Gnome Tweak Tool</a> or <a href="http://ubuntu-tweak.com/">Ubuntu Tweak</a>, specifically tailored to elementaryOS, has been requested many times before. Well you are in luck my friend, because here is just that: <b>elementary Tweaks</b>!
<br>

</center>
<br>
<br>
With elementary Tweaks, you can change themes, configure advanced Plank options, tweak animation timings, configure Files and Slingshot. And the best of all? It is written as a plug and therefor integrates into switchboard!
<br>

<br>
<br>
But that's just the icing on the glorious tweaking cake, now comes the frosting. I have packaged the <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/05/nitrux-icons-in-elementary-luna.html">Nitrux</a> and the <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/02/introducing-el-faenza.html">El Faenza</a> icon theme that were specifically tailored for elementaryOS for you. Additionally, I've thrown in some awesome elementary themes from DeviantArt user <a href="http://kxmylo.deviantart.com/">kxmylo</a>.

It doesn't stop here! You may have noticed the Workspace Overview and Show Desktop icon settings in the first screenshot. They add functional icons that just do what they say to Plank and are based on <a href="https://plus.google.com/111734729718206650167/">+Tom Beckmanns</a> <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/03/use-hotcorner-to-minimize-all-windows.html">Vala script</a>, <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/04/meet-sergey-snatsel-davidoff.html">Sergey "Shnatsel" Davidoffs</a> <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/elementaryos/+bug/946666">.desktop file</a> and the icons from our friend <a href="http://traumad91.deviantart.com/">TraumaD91</a>.

<br>
Enough with the teasing, let's get you hooked up with elementary Tweaks. First of all, if you haven't already, activate the elementary <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/05/announcing-community-ppa.html">Community PPA</a> by opening your terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and typing:
<br>
<code>
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:versable/elementary-update<br>
sudo apt-get update
</code>
<br>
Then install elementary Tweaks:
<br>
<code>
sudo apt-get install elementary-tweaks
</code>
<br>
Optionally, install additional elementary themes:
<code>
sudo apt-get install elementary-dark-theme elementary-plastico-theme elementary-whit-e-theme elementary-harvey-theme
</code>
<br>
And the optimized icon themes:
<code>
sudo apt-get install elementary-elfaenza-icons elementary-nitrux-icons 
</code>
<br>
How about a bunch of Plank themes:
<code>
sudo apt-get install elementary-plank-themes 
</code>
<br>
<h4>ISSUES</h4>
Elementary Tweaks works great as it is. There are, however, some issues with the theming. After you have changed a window decoration or an interface theme it might not apply correctly. Just log out and back in and everything should be fine. Also bear in mind that elementaryOS only supports GTK 3.4 themes. If there is another problem, don't hesitate to <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/elementary-community/elementary-tweaks">post a bug here</a> and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.
<br>
<br>
<h4>TRANSLATIONS</h4>
Currently elementary Tweaks is available in English and German, but with your support it can be available in your language too! Just <a href="https://launchpad.net/+login">set up an account on Launchpad</a>, read the <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/Guide">Translation Guide</a> and <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/elementary-community/elementary-tweaks">start translating</a>!
<br>
<br>
<h4>CREDITS</h4>
Although I did write this plug, it is heavily based on code from <a href="https://plus.google.com/111734729718206650167/">+Tom Beckmann</a>, so much credit goes to him as well.

        <p>My <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/06/19/gelfands-question/">previous post</a> looked at a problem that requires repeatedly finding the first digit of <em>k</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> where <em>k</em> is a single digit but <em>n</em> may be on the order of millions or billions.</p>
<p>The most direct approach would be to first compute <em>k</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> as a very large integer, then find it&#8217;s first digit. That approach is slow, and gets slower as <em>n</em> increases. A faster way is to look at the fractional part of log <em>k</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> = <em>n</em> log <em>k</em> and see which digit it corresponds to.</p>
<p>If <em>n</em> is not terribly big, this can be done in ordinary precision. But when <em>n</em> is large, multiplying log <em>k</em> by <em>n</em> and taking the fractional part brings less significant digits into significance. So for very large <em>n</em>, you need extra precision. I first did this in Python using SymPy, then switched to C++ for more speed. There I used the <code>quadmath</code> library for <code>gcc</code>. (If <em>n</em> is big enough, even quadruple precision isn&#8217;t enough. An advantage to SymPy over <code>quadmath</code> is that the former has <em>arbitrary</em> precision. You could, for example, set the precision to be 10 more than the number of decimal places in <em>n</em> in order to retain 10 significant figures in the fractional part of <em>n</em> log <em>k</em>.)</p>
<p>The <code>quadmath.h</code> header file needs to be wrapped in an <code>extern C </code> declaration. Otherwise <code>gcc</code> will give you misleading error messages.</p>
<p>The 128-bit floating point type <code>__float128</code> has twice as many bits as a <code>double</code>. The <code>quadmath</code> functions have the same name as their standard <code>math.h</code> counterparts, but with a <code>q</code> added on the end, such as <code>log10q</code> and <code>fmodq</code> below.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s code for computing the leading digit of <em>k</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> that illustrates using <code>quadmath</code>.</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
extern &quot;C&quot; {
#include &lt;quadmath.h&gt;
}

__float128 logs[11];

for (int i = 2; i &lt;= 10; i++)
    logs[i] = log10q(i + 0.0);

int first_digit(int base, long long exponent)
{
    __float128 t = fmodq(exponent*logs[base], 1.0);
    for (int i = 2; i &lt;= 10; i++)
        if (t &lt; logs[i])
            return i-1;
}
</pre>
<p>The code always returns because <code>t</code> is less than 1.</p>
<p>Caching the values of <code>log10q</code> saves repeated calls to a relatively expensive function. So does using the search at the bottom rather than computing <code>powq(10, t)</code>. </p>
<p>The linear search at the end is more efficient than it may seem. First, it&#8217;s only search a list of length 9. Second, because of Benford&#8217;s law, the leading digits are searched in order of decreasing frequency, i.e. most inputs will cause <code>first_digit</code> to return early in the search.</p>
<p>When you compile code using <code>quadmath</code>, be sure to add <code>-lquadmath</code> to the compile command.</p>

  <p>James Gandolfini, the 51-year-old former construction worker behind arguably the greatest performance in television history, died on Wednesday of a suspected heart attack. <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/james-gandolfini-sopranos-star-dead-51-98501" target="_blank">HBO confirmed</a> the news shortly after initial reports broke. The commanding actor&rsquo;s character on <em>The Sopranos</em> not only earned him stacks of awards and later success in film, but kept audiences glued to the television in a way that revolutionized how people around the world would create and consume the medium. Not bad for a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/29/realestate/the-apartment-gypsies-of-manhattan.html" target="_blank">former nomad</a> who spent years coasting around New York chasing his acting dreams.</p>

  <p>Canada&rsquo;s controversial Concealment of Identity Act banning the wearing of masks during riots and "unlawful assemblies" has just gone into law, carrying with it a 10-year maximum sentence, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/06/19/pol-mask-bill-royal-assent.html" target="_blank">reports <em>CBC News</em></a><em>.</em> The private member&rsquo;s bill was introduced in 2011 by MP Blake Richards in response to the increasing prevalence of vandalism at political protests and sporting events.</p>

  <p>In the competition to establish the one true wireless power standard, the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP) is adding a big name partner today: Intel. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/7/3004669/powermat-samsung-qualcomm-alliance-for-wireless-power-formation">The A4WP was formed last year</a> by Samsung, Qualcomm, and wireless charging company Powermat, but now boasts over 50 members, including Broadcom, Sandisk and LG. That&rsquo;s roughly the same as the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and only a third the number of partners as the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), both of which back a different technology, inductive charging, under the names Qi and Power 2.0. Although the battle won&rsquo;t likely be won or lost by a single partner, Intel&rsquo;s decision is notable since it&rsquo;s the first time the company has publicly backed any wireless charging standard.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/15/4229290/twitter-reportedly-pursuing-deal-with-viacom-nbc-for-video-content">rumored partnership between Twitter and Viacom</a> has come to fruition. The companies <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130619-907485.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" target="_blank">said today</a> they have struck a deal to embed clips from popular Viacom shows and events inside Twitter, starting with the MTV Music Awards on August 25th. It's a high-profile push into television that could prove lucrative for Twitter as it prepares for an eventual initial public offering. </p>
<p>People will be able to tweet out ad-supported clips from the awards show, which Twitter says was the most-discussed news event of 2012 at 14.7 million tweets. Afterward, the ability to tweet clips will extend to shows on Viacom networks including MTV, VH1, CMT, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TV Land, and Spike, among others.</p>

  <p>Vine's founders have <a href="https://vine.co/v/huaOv2pBt11" target="_blank">taken to their own medium</a> to tease what appears to be a number of visual changes and new features to the video service's apps. The <a href="https://vine.co/v/huaAHbidhbj" target="_blank">apparent redesign</a> would have Vines blown up to the full width of a user's screen rather than existing within individual boxes. The change would create a nearly seamless feed of videos by removing the space that used to be dedicated to comments, likes, and share buttons. Instead, those elements would be overlaid on the very bottom of each post, while a persistent video capture button hovers at the bottom of the screen.</p>

  <p>Last week at E3, in a private room inside Microsoft's massive, green booth, Marc Whitten spent most of our interview talking about the future. "As we think of the next five to ten years of innovation," he said, "we're going to be able to drive really great new experiences. I'm personally most proud of the Xbox 360, and how different the 360 is from what it was in 2005. And that's all about making really big platform bets and bets about the future of entertainment." Whitten would talk about the launch experience at times, but he was much more interested in finding ways to guide Xbox users to the brave new connected world of gaming and entertainment.</p>
<p>Which made today's abrupt about-face all the more surprising. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4445984/xbox-one-policy-reversal-changes">Microsoft announced</a> that...</p>

    <div class="itemdescription" id="itemhttp://archlinux.me/dusty/?p=929">
        <p>This article continues the tutorial we started in <a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/2013/06/13/creating-an-application-in-kivy-part-1/">Part 1</a>. In the first part, we set up a Kivy project and developed a very basic Kivy application. We also discussed version control to aid in project management. In this part, we&#8217;ll be designing an actual user interface for a Jabber client and begin to implement it in the KV language.</p>
<p>Make sure you have completed part 1, or if you want to skip the preliminaries, you can clone the <a href="https://github.com/buchuki/orkiv/tree/end_part_one">end_part_one</a> tag of the <a href="https://github.com/buchuki/orkiv">Orkiv git repository</a> and start from there. It&#8217;s probably a good idea to name a new branch for your working changes so your master branch doesn&#8217;t diverge from my upstream repository. Remember to activate the virtualenv you created in Part 1 (or create one if you&#8217;re starting from the git clone.)</p>
<pre class="brush:bash">git clone https://github.com/buchuki/orkiv.git
git checkout end_part_one
git checkout -b working_changes
source venv/bin/activate
</pre>
<h4>Table Of Contents</h4>
<p>Here are links to other parts of the tutorial. I&#8217;m sorry for the navigation faux pas; blogs are not the best interface for multi-part articles.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/2013/06/13/creating-an-application-in-kivy-part-1/">Part 1: Introduction to Kivy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/2013/06/19/creating-an-application-in-kivy-part-2/">Part 2: Creating a form</a></li>
</ol>
<h4>Interface Design</h4>
<p>In general, before developing a user interface, it is a good idea to know what you want it to look like. I see this project having three main views. When the user first opens the application, they&#8217;ll see an <em>Account Details</em> screen to provide their jabber server and login credentials. We won&#8217;t bother with saving these details since this tutorial series is focused on Kivy interface development, not persistence. Once they have logged in, the other two views are a <em>Buddy List</em> and the individual <em>Chat Window</em>.</p>
<p>I would like to develop the app to show the buddy list and chat windows side by side if the screen is large enough (eg: a laptop screen or large tablet in horizontal orientation), but only one window at a time on small screens. It is very important to evaluate screen size when developing cross platform applications; it is generally not desirable or feasible to render the same view on large monitors and small phones. We&#8217;ll look at this feature in later tutorials, but knowing that we want to plan for it now will affect how we implement our design.</p>
<p>All of these windows are pretty simple. In this second part, we will focus on the account details screen. It will be a simple form with labels on the left and fields for entering the various details on the right. The fields covered will include server, username, and password. Below these fields will be a <em>Login</em> button. Normally I&#8217;d sketch the interface on a piece of paper, but since this looks like every other Jabber client on the market, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary.</p>
<h4>The Account Details Form Widget</h4>
<p>In Kivy, virtually every object that gets displayed on the screen is a widget. Just a few examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The label we rendered in the first tutorial</li>
<li>The text input fields and buttons we&#8217;ll render in this tutorial</li>
<li>Layout classes that contain other widgets and decide where they should be displayed</li>
<li>Complicated tree views such as file pickers</li>
<li>Movie and photo renderers</li>
<li>Tabbed boxes that display different widgets depending on the selected tab</li>
</ul>
<p>It is easy to make custom widgets, and to access all widgets, whether custom or otherwise, from KV language files. We&#8217;ll be creating a new widget to contain our entire <em>Account Details</em> form. Start by adding a new import and class to <code>__main__.py</code>:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="brush:python">from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout


class AccountDetailsForm(BoxLayout):
    pass
</pre>
<p>Running the code with this addition won&#8217;t change anything in the output, since the newly created widget hasn&#8217;t been added to the root window. However, there are a few things we need to discuss before we change the KV language file to use this widget. You might be asking yourself why we created a new widget instead of adding a <code>BoxLayout</code> widget (whatever that is!) directly to the root of the KV language file <code>orkiv.kv</code>. While it would have been trivial to do this, it would have made putting a new widget (such as the Buddy List) on the root screen more difficult. Further, when it comes time to attach events to the Login button, we can make it a method of this new class, where it makes the most sense.</p>
<p>The <code>BoxLayout</code> is a very simple widget that simply takes the available space and places all the child widgets in it from left to right or top to bottom. By default, each widget gets an equal amount of space, but it&#8217;s also possible to make certain widgets have specific sizes or percentages of space or to expand to fill available area.</p>
<p><code>BoxLayout</code> is one of several kinds of layouts available in Kivy. A layout is simply a container widget that holds other widgets and knows how to position those child widgets in a specific pattern. We&#8217;ll be seeing a <code>GridLayout</code> shortly. You can read about other Kivy layouts in the <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.layout.html?highlight=layout#kivy.uix.layout">Kivy API Reference</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s edit <code>orkiv.kv</code> to render this new widget as the child form instead of the label we used before. We&#8217;ll also add a couple labels to the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> class so you can see the relationship between root widgets and classes in the KV Language:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="brush:python">AccountDetailsForm:

&lt;AccountDetailsForm&gt;:
    Label: 
        text: 'Hello World'
    Label:
        text: 'Another World'
</pre>
<p>There&#8217;s a couple things going on here. The root widget of the <code>Orkiv</code> app is defined as a <code>AccountDetailsForm</code>. This is followed by a colon in case we wanted to add other child widgets to the object, but in this case, it&#8217;s just followed by a blank line. Then we define the structure of the child widgets of the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> class itself. We know it&#8217;s a class and not a root widget because the class name is surrounded in angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;). Further, one app can only have one root widget. We just defined that root to be pointing at a single <code>AccountDetailsForm</code>. However, note that a class can be styled once and added in more than one place. Just as our <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> has two labels, it would be possible (though silly, from an interface perspective) to create a container widget that contains two <code>AccountDetailsForm</code>s. The point is, an <code>AccountDetailsForm</code>, once its layout has been defined, can be used just like any of the built-in widgets supplied with Kivy.</p>
<p>If you run <code>python orkiv</code> now, it will render the two labels side by side, each taking a full half the window. Note that there are actually three widgets being rendered; first, the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> (which <em>is a</em> <code>BoxLayout</code> by inheritance) is rendered to fill the whole screen, and then it lays out the two labels as child widgets.</p>
<p>However, that&#8217;s not the AccountDetailsForm we were looking for! Let&#8217;s create our first nontrivial Kivy Language class. Replace the <code></code> class in your <code>orkiv.kv</code> with the following:</p>
<p></p>
<pre class="brush:python">&lt;AccountDetailsForm&gt;:
    orientation: "vertical"
    GridLayout:
        cols: 2
        Label:
            text: "Server"
        TextInput:
        Label:
            text: "Username"
        TextInput:
        Label:
            text: "Password"
        TextInput:
            password: True
    Button:
        text: "Login"
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s time to discuss just how the Kivy language lays things out. In my mind, it uses a box model similar to HTML, except instead of ugly HTML tags, indentation is used to specify what widgets go inside other widgets. Also, unlike HTML, style information is included in the <code>.kv</code> file instead of an external <code>.css</code> file. Though it&#8217;s not a hard and fast rule, style information (called properties in Kivy) typically begins with a lowercase letter, while child widgets start with a capital.</p>
<p>Look at the first level of indentation under the <code>&lt;AccountDetailsForm&gt;</code> declaration. There are three items; <code>orientation</code>, <code>GridLayout</code>, and <code>Button</code>. The former counts as &#8220;style information&#8221;. Remember that the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> class extends <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.boxlayout.html#kivy.uix.boxlayout.BoxLayout">BoxLayout</a>. One of the attributes on BoxLayout is &#8220;orientation&#8221;; we are telling BoxLayout here that we want a vertical layout.</p>
<p>This vertical box layout then contains two widgets, a <code>GridLayout</code> and a <code>Button</code>. The <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.gridlayout.html#kivy.uix.gridlayout.GridLayout">GridLayout</a> spaces all it&#8217;s children equally. We just have to tell it that there are 2 columns (the <code>cols</code> property) and then start adding our objects, which are displayed from left to right and wrap to the next row in the grid after every two widgets. We add <code>Label</code>s and <code>TextInput</code>s. Each label has a <code>text</code> property that we set using a further level of indent. The <code>TextInput</code> objects don&#8217;t require any extra properties except the password.</p>
<p>Later, we&#8217;ll have to give these objects some identifiers so we can refer to them in code. For this initial prototyping stage, we can start with the bare minimum. If we render the above example, we end up with a recognizable, but rather ugly form:</p>
<p><a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/files/2013/06/example_6.png"></a></p>
<h4>Restricting sizes</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s try to make the form a little less ugly:</p>
<pre class="brush:python">&lt;AccountDetailsForm&gt;:
    orientation: "vertical"
    height: "200dp"
    size_hint_y: None
    GridLayout:
        cols: 2
        row_default_height: "40dp"
        row_force_default: True
        spacing: "10dp"
        padding: "10dp"
        Label:
            text: "Server"
        TextInput:
        Label:
            text: "Username"
        TextInput:
        Label:
            text: "Password"
        TextInput:
            password: True
    Button:
        size_hint_y: None
        height: "40dp"
        text: "Login"
</pre>
<p>All we&#8217;ve done here is add some styling information to make the layout a little more friendly. This can be complicated as we want the app to look good on a variety of devices at a variety of resolutions and screen sizes. The main thing is to ensure all the widgets have a known height. As you might guess, this can be accomplished by adding a <code>height</code> property to each of the widgets. However, doing this alone will not work because <code>BoxLayout</code> likes to think of itself as in charge of deciding what size a widget should be. Without any styling, heights in a vertical <code>BoxLayout</code> are calculated as the number of widgets divided by the available screen space. However, it&#8217;s possible to tell <code>BoxLayout</code> to make certain widgets take a higher percentage of available space by giving it a <code>size_hint_y</code> attribute, which should be a float and defaults to 1.0. Unfortunately, for textboxes and buttons, percentages don&#8217;t really make a lot of sense, since we have no idea what size the window or screen of a particular advice is going to be, but we do know we want them to be about the same height on each screen.</p>
<p>So in addition to setting the <code>height</code> attribute, we also have to set <code>size_hint_y</code> to <code>None</code> for those widgets to prevent <code>BoxLayout</code> from ignoring the <code>height</code> property and laying things out by percentages instead.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also not that we are specifying the heights using strings that end in the suffix &#8220;dp&#8221;. It&#8217;s possible to provide integer values here, which would be interpreted as the number of pixels high the button is. However, due to the massive variance in screen resolutions on modern devices, it&#8217;s not really feasible to use pixels as a measurement. A login button that is 40 pixels high and looks good on a desktop monitor would look very small, indeed, on a &#8220;retina&#8221; display tablet.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kivy provides us with the concept of &#8220;display pixels&#8221;; hence the &#8220;dp&#8221; in the strings. Display pixels should be <em>about</em> the same size on every device; on a standard desktop monitor they generally map to a single pixel, but on higher density displays, they will be multiplied by a scaling factor. There are other <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.metrics.html">metric properties</a> such as <code>cm</code> or <code>in</code> that you can use, but I generally find it most convenient to think in display pixels.</p>
<p>Note also that instead of supplying heights for each of the <code>Label</code> and <code>TextInput</code> widgets inside the grid layout, we cheated and used the <code>row_default_height</code> attribute so all rows have the same height. For this to work, you also have to set <code>row_force_default</code> to True.</p>
<p>Finally we added <code>spacing</code> and <code>padding</code> properties to the <code>GridLayout</code> to add a 10dp space between child widgets and a &#8220;frame&#8221; around the whole <code>GridLayout</code> as well. If we run this example, it looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/files/2013/06/example_7.png"></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more thing I&#8217;d like to do before ending this part of the tutorial. As you can see above, the form is showing up at the bottom of the window, no matter what size the window is. That might look a bit bizarre on a tablet or even phone screen. It would be better if the entire form was anchored to the top of the window.</p>
<p>As an exercise, take a few moments to experiment (remember to use a different git branch!) and see if you can figure out how to move the form to the top by yourself. The next paragraph contains some hints if you get stuck, and the working code is linked after that. (I&#8217;m not about to tell you not to cheat, since it really depends what your personal goals are in reading this tutorial.)</p>
<p>There are probably multiple ways to do this, and I&#8217;m not even certain my solution is the best one. But I suggest making the <code>AccountDetailsForm</code> into an <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.anchorlayout.html">AnchorLayout</a> and anchor a child <code>BoxLayout</code> to the top of the form. Note that you&#8217;ll have to change both files to make this happen.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still confused, have a look at the full changeset at <a href="https://github.com/buchuki/orkiv/commit/6a9a815f29e3913bb4cf38125e21416ad3c7770d">the changeset</a> on github.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for part 2 of this tutorial, which focused on laying out widgets in the KV Language. In part 3, we&#8217;ll figure out how to log into an XMPP library and render a buddy list. Note that I don&#8217;t actually know how to do this, so we&#8217;ll have to figure it out together!</p>

        <p>Today's release of the Dart SDK and Editor is the first beta release, and contains performance and productivity improvements across the platform. This latest release helps Dart developers automate code evolution, produce smaller JavaScript code and deploy Dart web apps.</p> <p>The Editor's analysis engine, responsible for reporting warnings and errors, is completely rewritten and is 20% faster at parsing and analyzing. Now, there&#8217;s no need to run all the unit tests just to discover a typo.  The Dart Editor watches your back <i>as you type</i>.</p> <p>In addition, Dart Editor makes it easier for developers to manage an evolving app. Some of the new features include:</p> <ul><li>"Rename Library" refactoring</li><li>"Convert Method to Getter" and "Convert Getter to Method" refactorings</li><li>"Import Library" quick fix</li><li>"Create Class" and "Create part" quick fixes</li></ul> <p>Code completion has also improved. For example, completion is now camelcase aware. Type iE and Dart Editor finds isEmpty. </p> <p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a1rvpPDhkx8/UcHhYuzru8I/AAAAAAAAB_c/3S-e7pLZGok/s1600/image01.gif" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a></div></p> <p>Compiling Dart to JavaScript now results in smaller code. For example, some Dart programs that use reflection and HTML can compile to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=11218">JavaScript that is 3.7x smaller</a> than previous compilation sizes.  </p> <p>Dart VM performance has also improved. Compared against the previous release of Dart, <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/performance">DeltaBlue is 33% faster and Tracer is 40% faster</a>. This release also includes full <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/slides/2013/02/Bringing-SIMD-to-the-Web-via-Dart.pdf">SIMD acceleration</a> in Dart VM. </p> <p>Finally, deploying a Dart web app is now easier, with the beta <code>pub deploy</code> command. It creates a directory with your app's code and assets and prepares it for hosting on your favorite web server. You can use this command from Dart Editor or the <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/">pub</a> command-line utility. </p> <p>That's just the highlights - there are more improvements across the platform. You can read the full <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2013/06/release-notes-for-darts-beta-release.html">release notes</a> for more details and changes. You can download the latest version of Dart Editor, including everything you need for Dart development, from <a href="http://www.dartlang.org">dartlang.org</a>. We look forward to your feedback! </p> <p><span class="post-author">Dan Rubel<br>Productivity Enhancer, Dart Editor team</span></p>

<h2>The road ahead</h2>
<p>This is a landmark for feedly, as we go from being purely a reader to becoming a platform. Feedly cloud is the foundation that makes us completely independent from Google Reader. It will enable us to build features even faster, and deliver&#160;<a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2013/06/04/feedly-is-listening-the-roadmap-you-helped-us-shape/" target="_blank">the roadmap you helped us shape</a>. More to come very soon.</p>
<p><strong>There are only 10 more days before Google Reader is going away.&#160;</strong>Don&#8217;t forget to tell&#160;your friends to head to <a href="http://cloud.feedly.com" rel="nofollow">http://cloud.feedly.com</a> and migrate their Google Reader too. And let&#8217;s all wish Google Reader a happy retirement!</p>

        <p>This post is from <a href="http://www.chromestory.com">Chrome Story - The Best Chromebook Resource on The Planet!</a></p><p class="excerpt">Chrome team is working on more packaged apps (native apps for Chrome OS). The newest addition is the Chrome Remote Desktop app which got converted to a packaged app. Give me a Google Play Books packaged app and I will be a happy camper! ( I am sure you guys have your own wishlist for packaged apps!)</p>
<p class="excerpt">According to the&#160;<a href="https://plus.google.com/100132233764003563318" rel="author">Fran&#231;ois Beaufort</a>&#160;daily, &#8220;Chromium Team has recently started to work on a Chrome Packaged App version of the Chrome Remote Desktop Web-App aka Chromoting in the Chromium world.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="excerpt">Test This Now!</h3>
<p>The Chrome Remote Desktop packaged app is a work-in-progress, but if you want to try it out, <a href="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/Linux_x64/206911/remoting-webapp.v2.zip" target="_blank">here is the link for download</a>. Now,</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the zip file and extract it (double click on Chromebook)</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Enable the experimental extensions API flag from chrome://flags</span></li>
<li>Restart Chrome/Chromebook</li>
<li>Go to chrome://extensions</li>
<li>Check &#8220;Developer Mode&#8221;</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Load unpacked extension..&#8221;</li>
<li>Browse and select the newly downloaded file</li>
</ol>
<p>And you are done&#8230;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As of now, the app features a new design. We will see more features being added to the app soon. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Note: Not all features may work on Chromebooks</p>

        <p>This post is from <a href="http://www.chromestory.com">Chrome Story - The Best Chromebook Resource on The Planet!</a></p><p>Security experts have found a new vulnerability in the inbuilt flash player of Google Chrome. This new bug allows an attacker to take control of your webcam and microphone without your knowledge.</p>
<p>The worst part of this bug is, since it is affecting the inbuilt flash player of Google Chrome, it is applicable to all operating systems where Google Chrome with flash is available. This covers Windows, OSX and Linux and even your Chromebook.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Google has a policy of giving its vendor partners just one week to deliver a fix. This time, however, Google and Adobe got a bit of a late start. The proof-of-concept&#160;<a href="http://homakov.blogspot.ru/2013/06/camjacking-click-and-say-cheese.html">posted by Egor Homakov</a>&#160;five days ago was based on&#160;<a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182706/">a Russian post</a>&#160;that went live on the tenth.&#160;That means it&#8217;s already been more than a week, but Google pledged to deliver a fix before&#160;this&#160;week is over</em>, says <a href="http://www.geek.com/news/google-chromes-integrated-flash-player-allows-webcam-peeping-1559287/" target="_blank">Geek.com</a>.</p>
<p>We will see a security update soon, from the Chrome team, but till then, keep a watch over your extensions and apps. Especially, please do not install anything outside the Chrome Web Store. That alone won&#8217;t stop everything, but it is a start.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates.</p>

        <p><br><br><p><span>Have you ever wondered what happens inside a <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/jets">jet</a> of fluid as it breaks into droplets? Such events are not commonly or readily measured. This video uses a double <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/emulsion">emulsion</a>&#8212;in which <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/miscibility">immiscible</a> fluids are encapsulated into a multi-layer droplet&#8212;to demonstrate interior fluid flow during the <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/Plateau+Rayleigh+instability">Plateau-Rayleigh instability</a>. The innermost drops and the fluid encapsulating them have a low <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/surface+tension">surface tension</a> between them, thanks to the addition of a <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/surfactant">surfactant</a> to the inner drops. As a result, the inner drops are easily deformed by motion in the fluid surrounding them. Flow on the left side of the jet is clearly parabolic, similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen%E2%80%93Poiseuille_flow_from_the_Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">pipe flow</a>. Closer to the pinch-off, the inner droplets shift to vertical lines, indicating that the interior flow&#8217;s velocity is constant across the jet. After pinch-off, the inner droplets return to a spherical shape because they are no longer being deformed by fluid movement around them. The coiling of the inner drops inside the bigger one is due to the electrical charges in the surfactant used. (Video credit: <a href="http://fuckyeahdoubleemulsions.tumblr.com/">L. L. A.

During his testimony at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier today, Mueller bluntly told Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) that the FBI uses drones, but does so "in a very, very minimal way, and seldom." Later, after being pressed by Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA), he added that "It's very seldom used and generally used in a particular incident where you need the capability."</p>
<p>"I think the greatest threat to the privacy of Americans is the drone, and the use of the drone and the very few regulations that are on it today, and the booming industry of commercial drones," said Feinstein, who ironically...</p>

  <p>Sometimes a movie surprises you. Something you thought was going to be a mid-summer slog or an underwhelming riff on familiar themes turns out to be something more. Familiar tropes are reinvented, a tired villain gets new life, and presumed lines of safety are crossed. You find yourself in the middle of a relentless rush of anxiety, fear, and exhilaration, and when you walk out of the theater you can&rsquo;t wait to tell <em>someone</em> what you just witnessed.</p>

<p><em>World War Z</em> is that kind of movie.</p>

<p>The adaptation of Max Brooks&rsquo; best-seller has been best known up until this point for its production problems. Last year Paramount <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brad-pitt-world-war-z-production-nightmare-336422">delayed the film&rsquo;s original 2012 release date</a> to allow for extensive reshoots. Much of the blame was laid at the feet...</p>

  <p>The European Commission and officials in several countries are asking Google executive Eric Schmidt whether Google is equipped to deal with the privacy implications of its Glass heads-up display. <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/news-and-events/statements/privacy-statements/google-glass-letter-from-privacy-and-data-commissioners" target="_blank">In an open letter</a>, privacy commissioners from Israel, Switzerland, Mexico, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as a representative of the EU's privacy-focused Article 29 Working Party, raised questions about Project Glass' privacy policy and asked whether they could test its capabilities first-hand.</p>
<p>"To date, what information we have about Google Glass ... largely comes from media reports, which contain a great deal of speculation, as well as Google's own publicizing of the device," wrote the officials. Though Google has created...</p>

  <p>Dolphins' relentless smiles aren't smiles at all. <a href="http://www.aeonmagazine.com/nature-and-cosmos/lori-marino-dolphins-are-not-healers/" target="_blank">According to researcher Lori Marino</a>, the animal's jaw structure just happens to make it look that way &mdash; but that hasn't stopped humans from associating their apparently tireless grins with joy, healing, and divinity for millennia. Over the past several decades, that association has led people to believe in a supposed therapeutic relief that comes alongside swimming with dolphins, and healing seminars have popped up to capitalize on the notion. The therapies are marketed heavily toward helping autistic children and can cost thousands of dollars for a session. But as it turns out, there's no more benefit to swimming with dolphins than to running around with a dog.</p>

  <p>The largest association of doctors in the US has voted to change its definition of obesity, in a move that could catalyze major changes in insurance coverage, research funding, and public perception of the condition.</p>
<p>In a vote held yesterday by the American Medical Association (AMA) at their annual conference, association delegates <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2013/2013-06-18-new-ama-policies-annual-meeting.page" target="_blank">agreed</a> that obesity &mdash; primarily characterized by a body mass index above 30 &mdash; ought to be treated as "a disease, requiring a range of medical interventions." Research increasingly indicates, as the AMA noted, that obesity is a complex condition whose causative factors &mdash; like genetics or environment &mdash; are often beyond an individual's control. Previously, the AMA and other medical organizations had all...</p>

  <p>A film's trailer is practically a movie in itself &mdash; serialized into traditional trailers, red-band ones, teasers, and teasers of teasers, it creates a condensed version of the film full of fleeting references and heavy-handed setting of the narrative. There's a reason recut trailers are so popular: the tropes used in a trailer can drastically change a film's tone or even the decade in which it was apparently produced. In a multi-part feature (with links on the left of the page), <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/06/art-of-movie-trailer/" target="_blank"><i>Wired</i> takes a look</a> at what goes into a trailer, charting its history from the studio spectacles of the 1940s to the present-day summer blockbuster. And what, they ask, <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/06/best-trailer-of-all-time/" target="_blank">was the best trailer ever</a>? Hitchcock and Kubrick films get a mention, but at least one top...</p>

Today, the shackles come off: anyone can now create a Vdio account using their email address or Facebook login and start buying videos. The service is still only available to customers in the UK or the US, and it works just as it did in April. Users can buy or rent movies or TV shows for prices in the same range as what you'll find from Apple or Amazon, and they're only watchable on your computer or on your iPad using the Vdio app. Outside its fairly limited social features, Vdio hasn't exactly made a strong case for why people should use it over the...</p>

  <p>The bicycle helmet has massively reduced the risk of death from cycling. But present-day helmets are sorely unable to protect riders from less catastrophic concussions that can cause <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/4/3951510/can-technology-solve-the-nfls-head-injury-problem">serious long-term brain damage</a>, says <a href="http://www.bicycling.com/senseless/" target="_blank">journalist Bruce Barcott at <i>Bicycling</i></a>. The hard plastic is designed to take the brunt of a hard blow, not absorb the impact of a softer one, and designing a helmet that can protect against both is proving difficult. Safety is also, Barcott argues, being held back by the very standards meant to uphold it. Researchers have worked on creating better helmets, but since the safety certification rules aren't developed with concussions in mind, there could be little incentive to adopt them. "We'd created a situation where good...</p>

  <p>Back in March of 2011, Japan suffered its worst nuclear disaster ever as the Fukushima nuclear power plant suffered a series of equipment failures and meltdowns due to a massive earthquake. It was the largest-scale nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986 and caused the shutdown of all but two of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors. More than two years later, it looks like Japan's nuclear power plants will soon be coming back to life under tighter regulations. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/japan-formally-oks-nuke-safety-requirements-115000107.html" target="_blank">The AP is reporting</a> that the country's nuclear regulation authority has approved new safety requirements which should lead to the eventual reopening of Japan's nuclear power plants later this year or early next year. The new requirements will go into effect on July 8th, at which point...</p>

  <p>Microsoft is travelling to San Francisco next week to hold its annual <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/2/4173996/microsoft-build-2013-registration-price-date">Build conference</a> and convince developers to create Windows 8 apps. Exactly one week before the conference begins, it's unveiling a number of new Windows 8 applications that third-party developers have been working on. Popular DJ app edjing will be made available on Windows 8 this week, with pre-cueing and a pitch shifter feature to mix songs from a music library. It's one of the first big-name iOS and Android DJ apps to make its way over to Windows 8, and Microsoft claims it took 15 days to develop the app.</p>
<p>Continuing the theme of entertainment, Vevo, the music industry's video service for the web, is also debuting on Windows 8 this week. Vevo has created a Snap View...</p>

  <p>One of the most cherished and time-honored traditions of computer security conferences like <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/17/3249232/def-con-xx-twenty-years-of-hacker-evolution" target="new">Def Con</a> has been the Social Engineering contest. It's a simple but satisfying hacker bloodsport &mdash; contestants sit inside a glass isolation booth in front of a live audience and call up companies to see how many passwords, addresses, and other secret information they can coax from clueless customer service representatives.</p>
<p>Of course, the reason it's so effective &mdash; and thus, entertaining &mdash; is because social engineering bypasses firewalls and encryption to attack the most vulnerable component of any security system: humans.</p>

        <p>For today&#8217;s infographic we have a list of the top athletic facilities that US universities have to offer.  Say you are an athletic senior in high school looking for a place that invests in its athletic programs.  This can be a difficult and overwhelming decision.  This infographic makes it easy with ten great universities that invest in their sports programs.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s Clemson University, highlighting their tennis, basketball, football, and water sports. At Clemson there&#8217;s a unique facility for almost every sport.  University of Southern Florida also has an astounding amount of tennis courts available, as well as a rather large football stadium that was built recently.  There&#8217;s UNC, with a solid 18-hole golf course, and Auburn with a soccer stadium that fills 1,500 easily.  Louisville has one of the top golf programs in the country, while Appalachian State has a four mile stretch that is considered some of the best training terrains on the east coast.  The list goes on, naming more stellar programs and facilities across the US.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, we love sports.  To watch your favorite team win in a close match is one of the best pleasures in life.  These places are where that can happen for you. </p>
<p>P.S.  Where the heck is UT on this list?!  We pile so much money into our football program, it&#8217;s absurd.  Trust me, the stadium is legit. [<a href="http://www.pattersonpope.com" target="_blank">Patterson Pope</a>]</p>

        <p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GelfandsQuestion.html">Gelfands&#8217;s question</a> asks whether there is a positive integer <em>n</em> such that the first digits of <em>j</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> base 10 are all the same for <em>j</em> = 2, 3, 4, &#8230;, 9. (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/republicofmath">@republicofmath</a> for pointing out this problem.) This post will explore Gelfand&#8217;s question via probability.<span id="more-13595"></span></p>
<p>The MathWorld article on Gelfand&#8217;s question says that the answer is no for values of <em>n</em> less than 100,000. That range seemed small to me. My intuition was that you&#8217;d need to try larger values of <em>n</em> to have a reasonable chance of finding a solution.</p>
<p>So how big a value of <em>n</em> should you explore? To answer that question, consider picking <em>n</em> at random. If the leading digits of <em>j</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> were randomly distributed, what would the chances be that <em>n</em> would satisfy Gelfand&#8217;s question? Leading digits are not random, but they do often have regular distributions.</p>
<p>Suppose the leading digits are uniformly distributed among 1 to 9, and that the leading digits for each base are independent. Then the probability of <em>j</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> beginning with 1 (or any other chosen digit) for all <em>j</em> from 2 to 9 would be (1/9)<sup>8</sup>, and the probability of all leading digits matching any digit would be 9 times larger. That would say the probability of all leading digits matching would be on the order of 2 &#215; 10<sup>-7</sup>, so we should try on the order of 10<sup>7</sup> or 10<sup>8</sup> values of <em>n</em> to have a decent chance of finding one.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a problem with the above argument: leading digits are not uniformly distributed. Benford&#8217;s law says that leading digits are often distributed very unevenly. When a system follows Benford&#8217;s law, the probability of a leading digit being <em>d</em> is log<sub>10</sub>(1 + 1/<em>d</em>). An uneven distribution of leading digits raises the probability that all the digits will match. If the leading digits of <em>j</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> follow Benford&#8217;s law, and are independent, then the probability of all matching is 6.84 &#215; 10<sup>-5</sup>, two orders of magnitude higher than assuming a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>Do the leading digits of <em>j</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> follow Benford&#8217;s law? Yes, at least approximately, based on testing values of <em>n</em> from 1 to 1,000.</p>
<p>Now suppose the probability of a randomly selected value of <em>n</em> satisfying Gelfand&#8217;s question is <em>p</em> = 6.84 &#215; 10<sup>-5</sup>. If we tried 100,000 random values of <em>n</em>, the probability of having no successes would be about 0.00107. So my intuition was wrong. If the random heuristic given here were correct, we&#8217;d stand a good chance of seeing a solution if we tried values of <em>n</em> up to 100,000.</p>
<p>Where does the probabilistic heuristic go wrong? In the assumption that the distributions of the leading digits are independent.</p>
<p>Let <em>x</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> be the sequence <em>j</em><sup><em>n</em></sup> for <em>n</em> running from 1 to 1000. Some of the <em>x</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> are correlated and some are not.</p>
<p>Some of the correlations are easy to see. For example, the sequences for <em>x</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>x</em><sub>4</sub> have correlation 0.493. That&#8217;s because 4<sup><em>n</em></sup> = (2<sup><em>n</em></sup>)<sup>2</sup>. So if you know the first digit of 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>, you can often guess the first digit of 4<sup><em>n</em></sup>. In light of this, it&#8217;s not surprising that <em>x</em><sub>2</sub> is also correlated with <em>x</em><sub>8</sub>, and <em>x</em><sub>3</sub> is correlated with <em>x</em><sub>9</sub>.</p>
<p>You might speculate that <em>x</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> and <em>x</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> are uncorrelated if and only if <em>j</em> and <em>k</em> are relatively prime. Some sequences, such as <em>x</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>x</em><sub>3</sub> support that guess. But <em>x</em><sub>4</sub> and <em>x</em><sub>5</sub> are negatively correlated, <em>r</em> = -0.433, for reasons that are not obvious. I suspect that the negative correlations are the key to understanding the question.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I have verified that the answer to Gelfand&#8217;s question is no for <em>n</em> up to 10<sup>10</sup>.</p>

  <p><em>"You're pushing the Higgs too much."</em></p>

<p>Such has been Peter Higgs' admonishment to the CERN communications department in recent times. The British theoretical physicist, who has contributed both his work and name to the prediction of an elementary particle called the Higgs boson, is unhappy to have the Large Hadron Collider so closely associated with the search for it. Having now established that particle's existence to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4102840/higgs-boson-particle-discovery-now-more-likely-than-ever">a high degree of certainty</a> &mdash; there's only a one in 10 million chance that CERN&rsquo;s observations are not the result of the Higgs boson &mdash; the LHC is running the risk of being perceived as an expensive one-trick pony that's already completed its objective.</p>

<p>To allow that misconception to fester would be doing a massive...</p>

  <p>Warner Bros. has just released the first trailer for the <i>The Lego Movie</i>, an upcoming film based on the popular building blocks. Directed by<i> Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs</i>'  Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the movie thrusts an ordinary Lego figure, mistakenly identified as "the MasterBuilder," into a quest to stop an evil tyrant from gluing the Lego universe together. As is customary for big-budget animations, a lot of talent is signed up to voice the characters, including Morgan Freeman, Will Ferrell, Alison Brie, Liam Neeson, and Will Arnett.</p>
<p>Opening with a playful bait-and-switch for <i>Avengers 2</i>, the trailer is strong, and it's reassuring that the characters seem to be restricted to "realistic" Lego movement, rather than fluidly...</p>

  <p>As part of <i>Late Night</i>'s<i> </i>"Video Game Week," Jimmy Fallon has had the opportunity to play with both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4. But while Monday night's Xbox One demo ran through the console's multimedia features and showed off <i>Killer Instinct</i> and <i>Forza</i>, Sony Tuesday night also took the opportunity to highlight its competitor's complex online and used game policies.</p>

  <p><i>Breaking Bad</i> star Bryan Cranston has taken to Reddit for an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1glx04/i_am_bryan_cranston_ama/" target="_blank">Ask Me Anything (AMA) session</a>. As expected, the majority of questions center around his work on the hit TV show and his portrayal of meth kingpin Walter White, but Cranston also confirms he was once a voiceover artist for the <i>Power Rangers</i>, talks about his charity commitments, and offers some very dark responses in his examination by Reddit users. If you can't wait for the final season of <i>Breaking Bad</i> to begin, Cranston's AMA may help tide you over until Heisenberg returns to wreak havoc on our screens on August 11th.</p>

  <p>Tesla is <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/partial-recall" target="_blank">recalling some Model S vehicles manufactured</a> between May 10th and June 8th 2013. In a PSA on the company's website, Tesla founder Elon Musk notes that an incorrectly-welded mounting bracket for the left-hand latch of the rear seats "could be weaker than intended."</p>
<p>The defect could cause the seat back to come loose in the event of a crash. Musk stresses that there have been no complaints, no injuries (that the company is aware of), and no weld failures. Customers affected by the fault will be contacted by Tesla, which will pick up the car from "a location of the owner's convenience" and provide a Model S loaner while the issue is addressed, which Musk says will take "a few hours."</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/12/3760192/john-mcafee-run-from-the-law">strange tale of John McAfee</a> keeps getting stranger. In a video posted to YouTube last night, the antivirus software founder and part-time fugitive callously sends up the program he helped create. Framed as a four-minute instructional video, "How To Uninstall McAfee Antivirus" features plenty of green screen, degraded women, smoking, drugs, partial nudity, and firearms. In the "humorous" skit's last act, McAfee finally gets around to explaining how to remove his former company's anti-virus software. Enjoy a bizarre NSFW four minutes and 26 seconds you'll never get back.</p>

        <p>Google announced <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/111166827982420581810/118170059441102440825/posts/JwvEtqpWH5k">some Google+ changes</a> last week but some of them were rolled out gradually and I couldn't see them. <br><br>The Google+ notifications button looks different: it's now a bell. The number of new messages is more subtle and looks like iOS badges. The new notifications tray separates the messages you've read from the messages you haven't read yet. There's a new button that lets you "mark all as read" and a funny message: "All caught up!", but you can also mark as read a message by clicking the small "x" icon. All of this reminds me of Google Reader.<br><br>Thumbnails are bigger and you'll sometimes see 4 of them for each message. The notifications tray now supports infinite scrolling, so you can read all your messages, and Google remembers your state when you close the tray. You'll no longer be able to use the arrow keys to navigate when you click the bell icon, but the keyboard shortcuts start to work when you click one of the messages (you can use j/k, left/right, up/down).<br><br>These aren't all the changes: "When you read a notification on one device, we'll mark it as read on your other devices. Likewise, dismissing a notification (with a swipe or a click) does so everywhere, so you can say goodbye to annoying repeats."<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br>Just in case you want to see the old interface for notifications, here are some screenshots:<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br>And here's a cool "jingle" animation from the new interface (click the bell when it says "all caught up"):<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br>{ Thanks, Garfield. }<div class="feedflare">

  <p>Over the past two weeks, the US government has insisted that its powers under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act require the NSA to get a "special, particularized order" from the FISA court to intercept an individual American&rsquo;s communications. Analyzing both the law on the books and NSA documents, Glenn Greenwald at <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/19/fisa-court-oversight-process-secrecy" target="_blank"><em>The Guardian</em> concludes</a> that in practice, the FISA Amendments Act allows the NSA to cast a much wider net, and that once the NSA secures FISA court approval, the decisions about which communications to "task" fall on individual analysts and their supervisors at the NSA. Further, while the government has argued that Section 702 is designed strictly to intercept foreign communications, NSA documentation indicates that...</p>

  <p>The latest software update for Sony&rsquo;s PlayStation 3 appears to be locking up some people&rsquo;s systems, leaving them unusable. <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/18/4443870/playstation-3-firmware-v4-45-released-reportedly-locking-up-some" target="_blank"><em>Polygon</em> reports</a> that Version 4.45 of the PS3 firmware was just released on Tuesday, but already, 23 pages of responses related to the issue have been <a href="http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-3-Support/Problem-after-update-to-4-45/td-p/40712247" target="_blank">posted to the PlayStation Community Forums</a>. While not everyone that has the new software is reporting the error, it does appear to be widespread, and we&rsquo;d advise holding off on that latest software update until Sony responds. We&rsquo;ve reached out to the company for comment and will let you know as soon as we hear anything.</p>

  <p>Nintendo will launch its first game with a free-to-play business model later this year. Speaking to <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/18/nintendos-free-to-play-game-is-steel-diver" target="_blank"><i>IGN</i></a>, veteran designer Shigeru Miyamoto said that the title could be shown off "relatively soon," and would be based on the 3DS game <i>Steel Diver</i>.</p>

  <p>Microsoft is planning to refresh its Surface RT with a Qualcomm processor. Existing Surface RT devices use Nvidia's Tegra 3 chipset, but <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-18/microsoft-said-to-add-qualcomm-as-surface-rt-supplier.html" target="_blank"><i>Bloomberg</i> reports</a> that a refreshed version will ship using Qualcomm processors, while Nvidia continues to be a supplier for "some versions." The switch to Qualcomm, which appears to be for unannounced Surface RT devices, will likely come into effect later this year.</p>

  <p>Dish Network has pulled out of the competition to buy third-place US wireless carrier Sprint after months of back-and-forth with competitor SoftBank. After seeing the Japanese operator table a buyout offer in October 2012, Dish countered with its own surprise bid in April, leading to some heated exchanges in the media. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/18/us-sprint-dish-softbank-idUSBRE95H1EM20130618?feedType=RSS&feedName=technologyNews" target="_blank">Reuters reports</a> that Dish will instead focus on acquiring Clearwire Corp. The company issued a statement on its change of plans in the form of a <a href="http://dish.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=772261" target="_blank">press release</a>, the full text of which is below:</p>

        <p>





  <p>Until now, saving attachments from a Gmail account to Evernote has meant either forwarding them to a special email address or dragging them into an open Evernote client. Today, the company released an arguably more elegant approach: <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/06/18/evernote-web-clipper-for-chrome-gets-gmail-clipping/" target="_blank">an update to its web clipper</a> that saves the entire message to Evernote, plus any attachments. </p>
<p>The new link between Gmail and Evernote makes for a easier way to keep track of files that might otherwise get lost in your inbox. You can save single messages or, by expanding the conversation, entire threads. As on other webpages, the clipper lets users choose a notebook to save to and to add notes and tags.</p>
<p>The clipper update is relatively minor, but could save time for people who spend a lot of time working...</p>

  <p>Following last year&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/15/3243887/netflix-nordic-countries-2012-international-expansion">first expansion into Europe</a>, Netflix is stepping into another nearby market: The Netherlands. Later this year, the low-altitude nation will be getting access to Hollywood fare, local and global TV and films, and Netflix&rsquo;s own original series like <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Arrested Development, </em>but so far the company hasn't announced any pricing information. Branching out into new markets has been a key goal for CEO Reed Hastings, who has overseen an expansion into over 40 countries over the past two years, including much of Latin America, the Nordic countries, the UK, and Ireland. Last month, reports in the Belgian press indicated that Netflix was planning to move into not only The Netherlands, but <a href="http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2013051727801/netflix-set-to-launch-in-france-the-netherlands-and-belgium.html" target="_blank">also France and...</a></p>

  <p>Nvidia has announced plans to license out its graphics technology out to other companies in an effort to take advantage of the huge market for smartphones, tablets, and other devices as its core PC business continues to shrink. <a href="http://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2013/06/18/visual-computings-ascent-gives-nvidia-room-to-expand-its-business-model/" target="_blank">According to a blog post</a> published by the company, Nvidia will start be licensing out the GPU core in its Kepler GPU, and it'll also license out its visual computing portfolio, which the company says will let licensees develop their own GPU technology while taking advantage of Nvidia's vast array of patents. Unsurprisingly, the impetus behind this change is the major shift in computing towards mobile &mdash; the company says that the "explosion of Android devices" presents it with a huge business opportunity even as...</p>

  <p>The US and Russian governments have agreed to repurpose a Cold War-era hotline in a new pact that they say will prevent any chance of cyberwar between the two countries. As a part of the agreement, formalized on Tuesday at a G-8 Summit in Ireland, the two nations said they will regularly share information on hacking incidents and other cyber attacks seen in their countries, both electronically and by way of a pre-existing direct phone line. The alliance comes after more than two years of negotiations between the US and Russia over what information should be shared and how, the White House said in a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/17/fact-sheet-us-russian-cooperation-information-and-communications-technol" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>

  <p>Chipotle is letting its customers know a little more about their burritos by opening up about the presence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) within its ingredients. The Mexican-themed fast food restaurant has begun <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/en-us/menu/ingredients_statement/ingredients_statement.aspx" style="background-color: #ffffff;" target="_blank">marking all products</a> that include GMOs on the company website, helping to bolster its focus on organic and local foods. <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/040751_Chipotle_GMO_labeling_Whole_Foods.html" target="_blank">According to <i>NaturalNews</i></a>, this makes Chipotle the first US restaurant chain to include such labels. Eventually, the chain also wants to eliminate GMOs from its menu entirely.</p>

        <p>This one comes by way of the Thomas Baruchel&#8217;s <a href="https://ttygames.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Games on the Linux console</a> blog, which is doing a much better job of indexing and displaying tty-based games than mine is.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.freshports.org/games/ztrack/" target="_blank">ztrack</a>, for the uninitiated:</p>
<p><a href="http://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/2013-05-04-solo-2150-ztrack.gif"></a></p>
<p>As it stands, ztrack is a very simple and very primitive racing game, drawn in 3D primarily with base ascii characters.</p>
<p>Colors are good, action is linear but quick to grasp. The animation is clean, if somewhat staggered. Pro tip: Watch your mirrors.</p>
<p>Controls are a little obscure, with O and P as left-and-right keys, an accelerator and brake at Q and A, as well as a cruise control at the spacebar.</p>
<p>I found that if I impulsively one of the arrow keys to turn, the program crashed.</p>
<p>No matter. It&#8217;s easy enough to follow and someone obviously put a lot of effort into the graphic portion.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on Thomas&#8217;s blog, by the way. Thomas takes the time to try and fix games that don&#8217;t work quite right, whereas yours truly, by virtue of relative programming ignorance, has to <a href="http://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/bonus-more-dead-soldiers/" target="_blank" title="Bonus: More dead&#160;soldiers">cast them aside</a>.  </p>

  <p>Since <i>The Guardian </i>and <i>The Washington Post</i> published a series of leaked documents, companies named as participants in the PRISM surveillance program have attempted to set right what they call "misleading" claims about their data. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/11/4419666/google-asks-to-publish-national-security-request-data">Google asked the attorney general and FBI director</a> to let it include requests made under the controversial FISA rules in its periodic transparency report, which details the number of requests for user information that it receives. Now, the company has filed a motion asking the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to allow it to publish estimated numbers of FISA requests without fear of reprisal.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the rather experimental fecal transplant procedure has been recognized through a number of studies as a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/24/4362050/fda-cracks-down-on-fecal-microbiota-transplants-c-difficile">reliable cure for the rare and debilitating disease</a> known as <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, or <i>C. diff</i>, FDA regulations made it difficult for doctors to reliably perform the operation. However, <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/NewsEvents/WorkshopsMeetingsConferences/ucm357258.htm" target="_blank">now the organization says</a> that it will "exercise enforcement discretion" and no longer require doctors to receive agency approval before performing the procedure. Earlier this year, the FDA introduced a policy that classified fecal transplants as an "investigational new drug," which meant that doctors needed to submit an extensive application to the agency and wait up to 30 days for a response &mdash; as a result, many doctors chose...</p>

        <p>Summer is nearly upon us. The kids are getting out of school, the ice cream man is making his rounds, and the air conditioners are being cranked at full blast. But just because vacation season is underway for most people, it doesn't mean that anyone is taking a break in our little mobile universe. We're a week out from Apple's big announcement of iOS 7, and the debate surrounding it is still going strong. Nokia recently teased us with an upcoming device announcement &#8212; could it be the long-awaited Windows Phone 'EOS' device with a real PureView camera? And Huawei just took the wraps off of its latest flagship handset. We'll be tackling all this and more in this week's episode of The Verge Mobile Show, so tune in around 4:30PM ET / 21:30 BST to catch it! </p>

  <p>A Nokia Lumia smartphone brought to you by Huawei? The idea might seem preposterous, but Richard Yu &mdash; chairman of the Chinese manufacturer's consumer business unit &mdash; says his company is "considering" such acquisitions. "Maybe the combination has some synergies," <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/ced47926-d80f-11e2-b4a4-00144feab7de.html#axzz2WbCMK79H" target="_blank">Yu told <i>The Financial Times</i></a>. Of course, he quickly clarified that any deal hinges on Nokia's willingness to be bought out. "We are open-minded," Yu said. Nokia's stock jumped upward as news of the executive's unprompted remarks spread. The struggling handset maker has given no indication it's for sale, however. In fact, Nokia is in the midst of a significant hardware push, having just released the Lumia 925 and Lumia 928; an "EOS" Windows Phone featuring a 41-megapixel camera...</p>

        <p class="itembyline">
        by Dinsan Francis
        in <a href="http://www.chromestory.com">Chrome Story</a>
        
    </div>
    <div class="itemdescription" id="itemhttp://www.chromestory.com/?p=8833">
        <p>This post is from <a href="http://www.chromestory.com">Chrome Story - The Best Chromebook Resource on The Planet!</a></p><p>The most popular question about Chromebooks. Can I install Photoshop on my Chromebook? Well, you cannot. May be in future, when Adobe releases a cloud powered version of Photoshop, may be. But until then, there are some alternatives. But before that I have to ask you one thing.</p>
<h3>Do you really need photoshop?</h3>
<p>Do not misunderstand me. I use photoshop, occasionally. I know many other people who use photoshop. But the percentage of people who use photoshop to its full power, is very less.</p>
<p>Most of us use it for basic image editing and photo manipulation. I am not saying everyone, but most. When web apps cannot replace photoshop for professional photographers and pro users, many of us can easily switch to web apps for most of our photo editing needs.</p>
<p>I have got some suggestions if you are interested.</p>
<h3>Chrome OS Image Editor App</h3>
<p>Chrome OS has a (very) basic image editor built in to the <a href="http://www.chromestory.com/2013/02/using-google-chrome-os-file-manager/" title="Using Google Chrome OS File Manager">Files app</a>. You can access it by clicking the edit icon (the pencil) while viewing an image from the Files app.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using the Chrome OS image editor you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;"><strong>Autofix</strong>: Adjusts color, tone and brightness etc automatically</span></li>
<li>Crop</li>
<li>Adjust brightness</li>
<li>Roate</li>
<li>Undo</li>
</ul>
<p>If you check &#8220;Overwrite original&#8221;, changes will be automatically saved to the current image. If it is unchecked, a new copy of the image will be created. All changes are saved automatically.</p>
<h3>Pixlr</h3>
<p>Pixlr offers a suite of web apps for photo editing and manipulation on the web. I have got three of them listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.55;">Pixlr Editor</strong><span style="line-height: 1.55;">: With a UI similar to photoshop, this tool has a lot of features to offer, and it is free. </span><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixlr-editor/icmaknaampgiegkcjlimdiidlhopknpk" style="line-height: 1.55;" target="_blank">Get the app here</a><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.</span></li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.55;">Pixlr Express</strong><span style="line-height: 1.55;">:&#160;</span><span style="line-height: 1.55;">Quick fix you photos with tons of adjustments, effects, overlays and borders!</span><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixlr-express/hojmjpdlmjopaeginhldhiokeidchjid" style="line-height: 1.55;" target="_blank"> Install from here</a><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.</span></li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.55;">Pixlr-o-matic</strong><span style="line-height: 1.55;">: Instagram like photo effects on the cloud. </span><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixlr-o-matic/ehcibdjmpjlekgjhepbfmenfppliikcj" style="line-height: 1.55;" target="_blank">Install from here</a><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many similar tools available on the Chrome Web Store. And pretty soon, we will see packaged apps with image editing capabilities, which will let you do some stuff without internet connection too.</p>

        <p class="itembyline">

    <div class="itemdescription" id="itemhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/?p=79500">
        <p><strong><a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Untitled-1.jpg"></a>Several high-profile telecom carriers have signalled their interest in supporting&#160;<em>Ubuntu Touch -&#160;</em>Canonical&#8217;s mobile platform. </strong></p>
<p>The &#8216;<em>Carrier Advisory Group&#8217;</em> (&#8216;CAG&#8217;) formed by Canonical, and announced today, will provide a <em>&#8216;forum for mobile operators to influence the development of Ubuntu for smartphones.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>So far there are eight members of the group:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deutsche Telekom</strong></li>
<li><strong>Everything Everywhere (EE)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Korea Telecom</strong></li>
<li><strong>Telecom Italia</strong></li>
<li><strong>LG UPlus</strong></li>
<li><strong>Portugal Telecom</strong></li>
<li><strong>SK Telecom</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unnamed Spanish network</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>What Does This Mean?</h4>
<p>Eight telecoms carriers means it&#8217;s time to get excited, right? Not quite.</p>
<p>The CAG formation shows that there is a strong level of interest from the associated carriers in Ubuntu Touch as a platform &#8211; but it&#8217;s not a commitment to launch Ubuntu Touch on their networks ASAP.</p>
<p>Many of the companies are also part of other advisory projects for other mobile OSes. <em>Deutsche Telekom</em> and <em>Telefonica</em> &#8211; rumoured to be the &#8216;unnamed spanish carrier&#8217; &#8211; for example, are also involved with Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox OS, as are&#160;<em>SK Telecom. Sk Telecom&#160;</em>also find time to be part of the<em> Tizen Advisory Group.</em></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s still very good news for Canonical and anyone hoping to see Ubuntu Touch made a success.</p>
<p>The companies involved in the CAG will be briefed &#8220;about device manufacturer plans to support the OS, as well as the opportunity to be a launch partner for Ubuntu on smartphones,&#8221; Canonical has said.</p>
<p>The group will also hold meetings to discuss topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em style="font-size: 14px;">Differentiation for OEMs and operators</em></li>
<li><em>Developer ecosystems and application portability from Android and Blackberry</em></li>
<li><em>HTML5 standards</em></li>
<li><em>Performance and compatibility</em></li>
<li><em>Marketplaces for apps, content and services</em></li>
<li><em>Revenue share models for publishers, operators and OEMs</em></li>
<li><em>Payment mechanisms and standards</em></li>
<li><em>Platform fragmentation</em></li>
<li><em>Consumer and enterprise market segments and positioning</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Mark Shuttleworth says that<em>&#160;&#8217;&#8230;the CAG allows us to draw on the insights and support of such a thoughtful and experienced group of industry partners.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>For more information on the&#160;<em>Carrier Advisory Group</em>&#160;head over to Canonical mini-site</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="omg-button informational-link" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/phone/carrier-advisory-group" target="_blank" title="carrier advisory group info page"> Carrier Advisory Group </a></p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Today&#8217;s CAG announcement marks a significant step forward for the fledgling Ubuntu Touch platform &#8211; but gaining the interest from carriers is only part of the battle.</p>
<p>Next, Ubuntu Touch needs to get device manufacturers on board, and harness the app developer community into producing high-quality, useful apps to fill the plugs that may be left by apps not willing to port over to the platform.</p>
<p>To get these carriers to take a punt on Ubuntu Touch it needs to start rising above the rest of the disruptive mobile OSes also vying for the same attention.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of ways to get <a href="http://elementaryos.org/support/live-support">help</a> and <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/04/where-else-to-find-elementary.html">interact</a> with other elementary Luna users. One of the most popular of these methods has been the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/104613975513761463450">g+ community</a>, boasting around 3,000 members. <br>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MWP3fNDoVOs/UcC5gblg6VI/AAAAAAAAB6g/hmKQeeJL5Jk/s1600/elementary+OS+forum.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a></div><br>

However, g+ presents some limitations, especially when attempting to find important content from past conversations. The <a href="http://www.elementaryforum.org/">elementary forum</a> started a little over a month ago to correct this problem and add more permanence to solutions of common questions. <br><br>

There has been a little traction, but it really should be more frequented than it is. So head on over, browse the <a href="http://www.elementaryforum.org/forum/main-category/news-announcements/87-faq-frequently-asked-questions">FAQ's</a> and be sure to <a href="http://www.elementaryforum.org/register">register</a>. Maybe even post a question or answer one while you're there!

        <p><br><br><p>Even something as simple as a falling sphere meeting a wall is composed of beautiful fluid motion. In Figure 1 above, we see side-view images of a sphere at low Reynolds number falling toward a wall over several time. Initially an axisymmetric <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/vortex+rings">vortex ring</a> is <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/flow+visualization">visible</a> in the sphere&#8217;s wake; when the sphere touches the wall, secondary vortices form and the wake vortex moves down and out along the wall in an axisymmetric fashion (Figure 2, top view). At higher Reynolds numbers, like those in Figure 3, this axisymmetric spreading of the vortex ring develops an <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/instability">instability</a> and ultimately breaks down.

  <p>The day before he turned 27, Nate Weiner drove from San Francisco to Mountain View for the most important meeting of his life. Weiner &mdash; he pronounces it "WINE-er," and yes, junior high <em>was</em> a rough time for him &mdash; made a mixtape for the occasion, something to boost his confidence before he sat down at his first negotiating table. As Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" played over the car speakers, he went through the slide deck in his head once again.</p>
<p>It was April 22nd, 2011. Weeks before, an executive at the remember-everything service Evernote had contacted him out of the blue with an offer to acquire Read It Later, <a href="http://www.getpocket.com/" target="_blank">now known as Pocket</a>, which Weiner began building in 2007.

  <p>Summer is nearly upon us. The kids are getting out of school, the ice cream man is making his rounds, and the air conditioners are being cranked at full blast. But just because vacation season is underway for most people, it doesn't mean that anyone is taking a break in our little mobile universe. We're a week out from Apple's big announcement of iOS 7, and the debate surrounding it is still going strong. Nokia recently teased us with an upcoming device announcement &mdash; could it be the long-awaited Windows Phone 'EOS' device with a real PureView camera? And Huawei just took the wraps off of its latest flagship handset. We'll be tackling all this and more in this week's episode of <i>The Verge Mobile Show</i>, so tune in around 4:30PM ET / 21:30...</p>

  <p>With questions about the NSA and FBI's surveillance programs mounting, President Barack Obama took to <i>Charlie Rose</i> last night to try to lay critics' concerns to rest. Between questions on Syria and cybersecurity talks with China, Obama defended the government's oversight of FISA data-gathering. Unfortunately, this didn't provide much in the way of new information: Obama largely raised the same points that he and others have brought up since the first documents were leaked, pointing to the focus on foreign intelligence, the limits on what can be collected, and the terrorist plots that were allegedly thwarted by surveillance.</p>

  <p>Microsoft <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/4/3729232/microsoft-socl-public-beta-social-network">opened the doors to its Socl social network</a> back in December, but the company has kept fairly quiet about its plans for the site ever since. After launching as a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/15/2517610/microsoft-socl-inside-the-companys-secret-social-network">limited beta</a>, Socl's mix of Facebook and Pinterest-like features has left Microsoft's social experiment in a research state with little focus on promoting its existence. Microsoft is aiming to keep Socl somewhat relevant with the addition of some new creation tools to help users share video and image content on the service.</p>
<p>The first addition is a Blink feature that uses an app for Windows 8 or Windows Phone to create short animated GIFs. The GIFs, or Cliplets as Microsoft calls them, can then be shared on Socl. Microsoft has a dedicated section for Blink, alongside...</p>

  <p>The film industry is obsessed with prequels, but there's one tiny problem: they rarely work. We know the eventual fate of the characters, so there are no stakes. We want to know more about iconic heroes, but seeing their backstory kills gravitas and mystery. From <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Prometheus</em>, the landscape is littered with films set in familiar worlds that never come together &mdash; and often harm the originals they&rsquo;re working from.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the environment <em>Monsters University</em> is walking into. A follow-up to 2001&rsquo;s <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, it&rsquo;s a test not only of prequels but of Pixar Animation Studios itself. A good-natured callback to the college movies of the 1980s, it&rsquo;s a tremendously entertaining family movie that shows Pixar hasn&rsquo;t...</p>

  <p><small>US Congressman Anthony Weiner</small></p>
<p>New York's thriving tech sector may wish Mayor Michael Bloomberg would keep extending those term limits.</p>
<p>Come January 1st, the country's largest and most influential city, as well as its second largest hub for tech companies, will have a new leader. Judging from a <a href="http://www.queenstech.org/techforummayor/" target="new">panel discussion last night</a> between four of the candidates, not one appears ready to fill Bloomberg's shoes when it comes to thinking creatively about technology.  </p>

  <p>When Amazon debuts its original series<i> Alpha House</i> this fall, it won't be releasing the entire season all at once. That's according to executive producer Jonathan Alter, who told <i>The Wrap </i>that while Amazon hasn't yet finalized a release structure for the show, it's already decided not to follow the signature approach of streaming rival Netflix. "It hasn&rsquo;t been entirely determined how they&rsquo;ll put it out," he said. "But it will be a different model" than the binge-friendly delivery method Netflix has employed for <i>House of Cards</i>, <i>Arrested Development's</i> fourth season, and other original programming. Will Amazon adhere to the staggered schedule of traditional cable, or come up with its own strategy? The company has time to decide; <i>Alpha...</i></p>

  <p>Gaming auteur Ken Levine started out as an aspiring screenwriter before moving on to Looking Glass Studios and eventually the immensely successful <i>BioShock </i>series. <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2013/06/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-takes-on-logans-run-script-for-warner-bros/" target="_blank">According to a <i>Deadline</i> report</a>, he's now making another foray into film: He's apparently attached to a remake of 1976 cult classic <i>Logan's Run</i>. This remake has been in the works for years, with an earlier script penned by <i>28 Days Later</i> and <i>The Beach</i> writer Alex Garland and others. But the project was officially put on hold in May, some months after prospective star Ryan Gosling dropped out.</p>
<p>Now, Levine is said to be writing a new script for Warner Bros., though he will continue to focus on video games. Of course, the project has long been in development hell, so there's no...</p>

        <p class="itembyline">

        <p>This post is from <a href="http://www.chromestory.com">Chrome Story - The Best Chromebook Resource on The Planet!</a></p><p>Ho do I install software on my Chromebook &#8211; This is one of the first questions new Chromebook users ask. And the answer is yes and no. Well, it used to be mostly &#8220;No&#8221; because there were no programs for Chromebooks because everything happened on the web. But lately, things changed and there are more native apps coming to Chrome OS which you can call &#8220;software&#8221; or &#8220;programs&#8221; for Chrome (and Chrome OS) to certain extent.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at this in detail.</p>
<h3>Web Apps</h3>
<p>Web Apps are mostly websites that you access using your Chromebook. You can install web apps from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>. These apps add icons to your apps menu (similar to your Android or iOS device). You click them to open those apps/websites.</p>
<p>Pretty simple and straight forward, right? And in case you were wondering, you can always open those web apps on your browser without installing the app.</p>
<p>These may not work when your are offline (without internet)</p>
<h3>Native Apps for Chromebooks</h3>
<p>Chromebooks have their own apps called &#8220;packaged apps&#8221;. These apps work on Chromebooks and Chrome browser on Windows or OSX as well. &#160;They work offline too, by default.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is the official description:</p>
<p><em>These combine the best of websites and native applications &#8212; they&#8217;re available offline &amp; from any computer, are always up to date, and they can communicate with devices like USB drives &amp; Bluetooth speakers.</em></p>
<p>You can install them from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/packaged_apps" target="_blank">packaged apps section of the Chrome Web Store</a>.</p>
<p>Here is one more introduction for packaged apps, written for developers</p>
<p><em>Packaged apps deliver an experience as capable as a native app, but as safe as a web page. Just like web apps, packaged apps are written in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. But packaged apps look and behave like native apps, and they have native-like capabilities that are much more powerful than those available to web&#160;</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are a developer, you can get more information from <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Recap</h3>
<p>The idea behind the Chrome OS operating system is to move your computing to the cloud. This makes it possible to have a computing experience where you do not worry about backups, updates or security. Apps on Chrome OS update themselves in the background. If you are using a web app, it gives you the latest version always.</p>
<p>However, Chromebooks come with basic features to get you through those situations where you end up without an internet connection with the help of apps with offline capability.</p>
<p>Apps are the software/programs on a Chromebook. There are two types of them, web apps and packaged/native apps. They update automatically. Packaged apps work offline by default.</p>

        <p>Creativity is a must.&#160; I can&#8217;t think of a time that being in the creative zone hasn&#8217;t helped turn stress into laughter, boredom into inspiration, or sadness into downright giddiness.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t think you are creative, don&#8217;t think that way.&#160; And for the record, creativity doesn&#8217;t have to refer to all the DIY madness floating around the internet.&#160; Creativity can come into play in all areas of life, so it&#8217;s beneficial to know how to work with it.</p>
<p>The infographic I&#8217;m featuring today is pretty sweet because it gives you ways to keep your creative juices flowing.&#160; By trying even a handful of these things, you&#8217;ll start to notice the creative beast in you coming out to play a little more often.&#160; When good ideas come your way, hold on tight to them&#8211;write them down if you have to. Ideas tend to slip from our memory as easily as our dreams do.&#160; Once you have a good grasp on your idea, dive in and watch it evolve.</p>
<p>I practice a lot of the things listed below, and they are all really helpful. Here are some other things I do: furious stream of consciousness writing on my typewriter, piece together eccentric outfits, and plaster favorite quotes all over everything. Enjoy!

  <p>Huawei is in London today launching its new smartphone, the Ascend P6. The first thing you'll notice about the P6 is it's incredibly thin &mdash; Hauwei says it's 6.18mm thick, which is far thinner than Apple's iPhone 5 or the Samsung Galaxy S4. Huawei also claims it's the "world's thinnest" smartphone, but as is often the case with such titles, that achievement is set to be eclipsed by <a href="http://androidcommunity.com/worlds-thinnest-smartphone-comes-in-at-5-6mm-thanks-to-china-20130503/" target="_blank">another Chinese competitor soon</a>. The Ascend P6 is pretty light: at 120g, it weighs 10g less than the Galaxy S4. Despite its small shell, Huawei has managed to squeeze in what are essentially the internals of the LG Nexus 4. There's a 4.7-inch 1280 x 720 LCD with in-cell touch, a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, a 2000mAh battery, and 8GB of internal...</p>

  <p>As first books go, Dr. Adam Rutherford probably couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a vaster topic: an investigation into both the origins of life itself, and the incredible potential of its man-made future. In <em>Creation: How Science is Reinventing Itself</em>, Rutherford offers a historical account of biology&rsquo;s biggest breakthroughs, before introducing readers to what he perceives as the next one on that list: synthetic biology, loosely defined as the radical engineering of new or novel life forms.</p>
<p>Fortunately for readers, Rutherford is uniquely suited to write such a tome. A geneticist by training, Rutherford contributes regular science columns to <em>The Guardian</em> and recently ended an 11-year stint as an editor at <em>Nature</em> to host a new, weekly BBC show, <em>I...</em></p>

    <div class="itemdescription" id="itemhttp://www.chromestory.com/?p=8823">
        <p>This post is from <a href="http://www.chromestory.com">Chrome Story - The Best Chromebook Resource on The Planet!</a></p><p>Google just tripled the number of retail outlets for <a href="http://www.chromestory.com/google-chromebook/" target="_blank" title="Chromebooks">Chromebooks</a>! They added Walmart, Staples and a few more retailers to the network, which brought the number of stores selling Chromebooks to&#160;&#160;6,600. Here is the official <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.in/2013/06/chromebooks-coming-to-more-stores-near.html" target="_blank">announcement</a></p>
<p><em>In addition to Best Buy and Amazon.com, we&#8217;re excited to welcome several new retailers to the family. Starting today, Walmart will be making the newest&#160;<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/acer-c7-chromebook.html">Acer Chromebook</a>, which has a 16GB Solid State Drive (SSD), available in approximately 2,800 stores across the U.S., for just $199. Look for Chromebooks coming to the laptop sections of a Walmart near you this summer.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>And beginning this weekend, Staples will bring a mix of Chromebooks from Acer, HP and Samsung to every store in the U.S.&#8212;more than 1,500 in total. You can also purchase via Staples&#160;<a href="http://www.staples.com/Google-Chromebooks/cat_CL167985">online</a>, while businesses can purchase through the Staples Advantage B2B program. In the coming months select Office Depot, OfficeMax, and regional chains Fry&#8217;s and TigerDirect locations will begin selling Chromebooks.&#160;</em></p>
<p>If you are visiting Walmart to check out Chromebooks, you will get to see only the $199 Acer version (with SSD not HDD). Staples will sell more brands, HP and Samsung along with Acer. However, this may change quickly since Google says they are working hard to get more brands available through more retailers in more countries.</p>
<p>Okay, I have heard that &#8220;more countries&#8221; talk a lot, so I am not excited about that part. But the idea of bringing Chromebooks closer to more shoppers is of course a welcome move.</p>

        <p>Several people have asked me what kind of work I&#8217;ve been doing since I went out on my own earlier this year. So far I&#8217;ve done a lot of fairly small projects, though I have one large project that&#8217;s just getting started. (The larger the project and client, the longer it takes to get rolling.)</p>
<p>Here are some particular things I&#8217;ve been doing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Helped a company improve their statistical software development process</li>
<li>Modeled the efficiency and reliability of server configurations</li>
<li>Analyzed marketing and sales data</li>
<li>Coached someone in technical professional development</li>
<li>Wrote an article for an online magazine</li>
<li>Helped a company integrate R into their software product</li>
<li>Reviewed the mathematical code in a video game</li>
<li>Researched and coded up some numerical algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p>If something on this list sounds like something you&#8217;d like for me to do with your company, please <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/contact.html">let me know</a>.</p>

  <p>Sony's Xperia Z, the high-end, ruggedized Android phone that was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3836504/sony-xperia-z-launch-specs-features-release-date">announced at CES</a>, is getting its first launch on a US carrier. The phone will be available exclusively on T-Mobile in the "coming weeks;" it will come in both black and a limited-edition purple model. The Z is Sony's latest flagship phone, and it sports a 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor, 1080p display, and a 13-megapixel Exmor RS camera that Sony touts as offering HDR video &mdash; though we found the camera underwhelming <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4084004/sony-xperia-z-review">in our review</a>. Unusually for a US phone, it comes with a water-resistant coating, something that sets an otherwise relatively ordinary device apart from comparable Android phones.</p>

  <p>A couple years ago, Microsoft vet Georg Petschnigg set out to redefine the way we draw, paint, and sketch on iPad. He assembled <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/" target="_blank">FiftyThree</a> &mdash; a team of individuals &mdash; some of whom were left over from Microsoft&rsquo;s scrapped Courier project, and began work on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8" target="_blank">Paper</a>. "We&rsquo;ve just burned down our savings on this," he <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/29/2909537/paper-drawing-ipad-app-fiftythree-brains-behind-courier" target="_blank">said</a>, "to build tools we could use every day." Paper caught on, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/12/2943574/paper-for-ipad-sales-fiftythree" target="_blank">was downloaded 1.5 million times in its first two weeks</a>. Today, Paper has reached 8 million downloads and has been used to create over 80 million pages. The company has grown to 22 people, yet it still works out of Petschnigg&rsquo;s Tribeca apartment building.</p>

  <p>When Hurricane Sandy tore through New York City last year, some of the most stirring photos &mdash; aside from those chronicling the storm&rsquo;s devastation &mdash; were of city residents helping one another keep their smartphones charged up and powered on. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39351804@N06/8236323053/in/photolist-dxPiTT-dpydPR-doR9e4-dLKMjy-dLKMbu-dovKQe-auqc4W-dqUsST-drdJRz-dpKNyG-dq8Fiv-dqqmnv-dq34qs-dq2CqB-auqd8w-auqcs9-bu9VaN-dpRQJQ-dGNYZz-dGNZ6a-dxPjbT-dxUMuC-dxUMBy-dtcbaD-dq4sDM-dvFFVn-dvFFZV-dq8iAu-dq89oZ-dq8iK5-dq8j1L-dq8i1W-dq8idE-dpRPhP-8Nx6hW-dqM9S7-dqmWhi-c9db5N-drFmrh-dpMr7t-dpBTm3-dpBBLu-dpPTbp-drzFJP-dpxsbm-dqM9DY-7VQPou-dpqLSx-dsa83h-dpRK7t-9BbPSv" target="_blank">Daisychained powerstrips were a common sight</a> throughout the five boroughs, and lines stretched out the door at locations where charge was available.

  <p>Last month, Adobe dropped a bombshell on users of its Creative Suite apps: going forward, all of its apps under the umbrella, from Photoshop and Illustrator to Dreamweaver and After Effects, would <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/6/4305300/adobe-announces-creative-suite-update-and-rebranding-focus-on-cloud">fall under the umbrella of Creative Cloud</a>, its monthly subscription service. While the decision has been divisive, one thing is clear: if you want new Photoshop features, Creative Cloud is your only way in. Today, Adobe is unveiling all of the updated apps it announced in May, and we took the opportunity to look at what separates Photoshop CC from its CS6 predecessor.</p>

        <p>Google tests a new interface for the mobile Gmail web app. The toolbar that includes buttons for archiving messages, marking as unread or adding labels now floats above the message and it no longer has a fixed position.<br><br>Here's the new interface that's currently tested (stock Android browser):<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="display: inline;"></div><div style="display: inline;"></div></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="display: inline;"></div><div style="display: inline;"></div></div><br>And here's the regular interface (mobile Chrome):<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="display: inline;"></div><div style="display: inline;"></div></div><br>As you can see, the Gmail mobile site goes back to the roots. Back in 2009, <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-mobile-gmail-experience-for-iphone.html">Google added a similar bar</a> to the mobile site: "We made extensive use of other browser functions too: for example, the floaty bar that lets you archive, delete or apply more actions is animated via CSS transformations and controlled in part with touch events (when you scroll the screen, it follows you)."<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="feedflare">
