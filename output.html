        <p>There's a weird regression in Google Image Search if you use Chrome 27+ and enable "Extended Instant API" in <i>chrome://flags</i>. Extended Instant is a feature <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2013/03/chromes-integration-with-google-search.html">I've mentioned a few months ago</a> and it's still a work in progress. It integrates Chrome with Google Search, replaces the new tab page with a special version of the Google homepage and removes the navigation bar and the search box from Google's search pages.<br /><br />Back to Google Image Search. For some reason, when Extended Instant is enabled, Google Image Search switches to the old interface: thumbnails are smaller and you can mouse over to see more details about the images. When you click an image result, Google sends you to a new page that loads the original image file.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0sz-rSvU590/UYflwPkMLaI/AAAAAAABJME/eaX7srnARmA/s640/old-google-image-search-chrome.jpg" /></div><div class="feedflare">

<p><strong>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted here, but some of you may remember me for my short lived &#8220;Download of the Week&#8221; article while I was working at Canonical. Others may remember me for my ill-fated post on Eucalyptus &#8211; trust me, I got the hint &#8211; I will never post anything unrelated to the consumer side of things again!</strong></p>
<p>I may be working on Cloud software now, but Linux has always been my love, and I have spent the last number of months pondering something interesting I could do in that realm.</p>
<p>As I was wasting away hour after hour on Netflix (<a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/how-to-watch-lovefilm-redbox-instant-or-netflix-on-ubuntu" target="_blank" title="[How To] Watch LOVEFiLM, Redbox Instant or Netflix on Ubuntu">which can be viewed on Linux using this app</a>), I came across a Linux documentary called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_OS" target="_blank" title="Revolution OS On Wikipedia">Revolution OS</a>.</p>
<p>It was quite a focused piece, delivered some quality information, and did a great job of introducing people to the concept of F/OSS by interviewing the godfathers themselves, such as Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux kernel) and Richard Stallman (founder of the&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation" title="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a>).</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Raleway, Ubuntu, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">However, a couple of things stuck out for me:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Raleway, Ubuntu, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">One, it is a bit dated now (it was made before anyone knew what Ubuntu was). And two, while it did a decent job showing the practical side of Linux by showing the early successes of Red Hat and VA Linux, I would have like to have seen more in that regard.</span></p>
<p>I quickly decided it was time for me to make my own documentary on Linux.</p>
<h3>Linux Documentary 2.0</h3>
<p>I plan to kick things off in the same vein as Revolution OS by introducing everyone to the concept of F/OSS. While this won&#8217;t be my focus, I would be remiss to leave this out as Linux wouldn&#8217;t be what it is today if it were proprietary software. I hope to interview Stallman, Linus, and perhaps others for this. I will also focus on the nature of the Linux community in this segment and hope the likes of my former colleague <em>Jono Bacon</em> and current colleague <em>Greg DeKoenigsberg</em> will help me out there.</p>
<div class="pull-quote pull-quote-right"><p>&#8220;In the meat of the documentary, I want to focus on where Linux is in regards to its various uses.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>In the meat of the documentary, I want to focus on where Linux is in regards to its various uses such as on the Desktop, on the Server, in the Cloud, and on Mobile devices. For this I hope to interview my former bosses Michael Robertson, Kevin Carmony, and Mark Shuttleworth for the desktop end of things. For those who don&#8217;t know anything about Lindows/Linspire, you&#8217;re in for a real treat! On the server side, I will be reaching out to Red Hat, SuSe, and my fellow cohorts within Debian and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Lastly, I will focus on where Linux is<em> going</em>.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is a rather nascent art right now, but Linux is leading the way both as a hosting platform and as the client service. Naturally I will be requesting an interview from my boss Marten Mickos, CEO at Eucalyptus and former CEO of MySQL, and others such as my former colleague at Canonical, Co-Founder of the OpenStack project, and current Project Lead for OpenStack Rick Clark.</p>
<div class="pull-quote pull-quote-right"><p>&#8220;A hobby that spawned a revolution, Linux is everywhere. But where can it go from here?&#8221;</p></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to name drop, but the one criticism the Kickstarter admins had was that I didn&#8217;t mention anyone I would be interviewing. I left this out intentionally as I didn&#8217;t want anyone contributing funds to see a particular individual and my not being able to secure an interview with that individual.</p>
<p>I can better explain here that these are the people I wish to interview, and I am very confident that I can gain an audience with them as I have worked for or with most of them in the past. The two very notable exceptions are Linus and Richard. I have a friend who can likely deliver Richard, but sadly, I have never had the pleasure of crossing paths with the man himself, Linus. If any of you out there are in his inner circle, go chip in 10 bucks first and then hook me up!</p>
<p><strong>If you think a documentary about Linux would interest you, you can make it happen by pledging a few dollars to my Kickstarter campaign.</strong></p>

<p>Sharing is getting a bit easier on Google Drive today. Google has just announced that users on a PC or Mac can now share files simply by right clicking and choosing "share" from a Google Drive submenu. The file(s) in question will need to be in your Google Drive folder, of course. It's a small addition (we're sure power users appreciate the move), but it brings Drive's desktop app even closer in functionality to Dropbox. Google says the new quick sharing functionality will roll out to its Google Drive app for PC and Mac over the next few days, so if you're not seeing anything upon a right click of your mouse or trackpad, don't despair.</p>

<p>Adobe has announced the next major upgrade to its flagship digital editing tools, the Creative Suite, and the entire series is getting a new, but familiar name to emphasize what the company is focused on. Adobe Creative Cloud will be replacing Creative Suite 6, the version released last year. The product series has been on a yearly release cycle since 2011, and this latest upgrade includes new features for nearly every product in the suite, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro, all of which now have their name appended with CC, instead of CS.</p>
<p><em>This post is developing. We&#8217;ll update as Adobe announces more details during its keynote at MAX 2013.</em></p>

<p>The longrunning, controversial rumor that Microsoft's Xbox 360 successor would demand an internet connection for all aspects of its functionality has finally been put to rest. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fgaming%2F2013%2F05%2Fmicrosoft-next-xbox-will-work-even-when-your-internet-doesnt%2F" target="_blank"><em>Ars Technica</em> is today reporting</a> that an internal Microsoft memo &#8212; sent to all employees working on the next-gen console &#8212; has dismissed the 'always-on' mandate. Referring to the hardware by its codename Durango, Microsoft reportedly wrote, "There are a number of scenarios that our users expect to work without an Internet connection, and those should 'just work' regardless of their current connection status. Those include, but are not limited to: playing a Blu-ray disc, watching live TV, and yes playing a single player game."</p>
<p>With that one, surprisingly informative line, the company has essentially confirmed two major features of the upcoming Xbox: it will utilize Blu-ray optical media and can also double as a cable set-top box. Though it stops short of mentioning an HDMI input, Microsoft's tidbits line up nicely with <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F10%2F4208970%2Fnext-xbox-tv-entertainment-plans">what we reported early last month</a>. The Xbox 360 never quite made good on its live TV potential, but it seems that Redmond is determined to get it right this time. We'll be hearing much more about the next-generation Xbox <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F24%2F4261518%2Fnext-xbox-will-be-revealed-on-may-21st%2Fin%2F2495929">at its public unveiling on May 21st.</a></p>

        <p>The latest version of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/gmail-email-from-google/id422689480?mt=8">the Gmail app for iOS</a> added a feature that opens links using other Google apps: Chrome, Google Maps and YouTube, assuming you've already installed them. It works well for Google Maps links and YouTube links, but not that well for other links: some open using Chrome, but most links open using the internal browser of the Gmail app.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6JKdaSrNUgc/UYfXZsMqVMI/AAAAAAABJLE/Q7G9b57Gz9Y/s640/gmail-ios-links.png" /></div><br />If you don't like this feature, you can disable it by tapping the settings icon next to the account switcher, picking Google Apps and unchecking the apps you don't want to handle Gmail links.<br /><br />You can't change the default browser in iOS, but some Google apps include an option to use Chrome. For example, the YouTube app opens all the links using Chrome, if you've installed the app, and you can disable this feature from the settings. When you open a page from a Google app like YouTube, Gmail or Google+, Chrome shows a button that sends you to the previous app, just like the Android back button.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--awGubWWNaM/UYfbf6LSCxI/AAAAAAABJLU/sL3uUG4yQXQ/s640/chrome-ios-back.png" /></div><div class="feedflare">

<p>Three years ago, Sipho Molefe (not his real name) was a normal 16-year-old boy &#8212; an athletic, easygoing high schooler who was well liked among his peers in rural South Africa. Today, Sipho is unemployed, gaunt, and mired in a life of crime outside Durban, where he and untold others have been gripped by a drug known as "whoonga" &#8212; a potent and highly addictive mixture of marijuana, heroin, and, most shockingly, HIV medications.</p>
<p>"He has lost a lot of weight. He was a very fit and strong boy, and now he is thin and is sick," Sarah, Sipho&#8217;s mother, said through a translator in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. Sarah, 42, asked that her real name not be disclosed in this report, for fear of reprisal from local gang members and whoonga dealers. "He cries and hits his head when he cannot get whoonga ... He now steals my money, and has sold all his clothes just for the drug."</p>
<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="right">"He was a very fit and strong boy, and now he is thin and is sick."</q></p>
<p>Antiretroviral (ARV) medications have played an enormous role in <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unaids.org%2Fen%2Fresources%2Fpresscentre%2Fpressreleaseandstatementarchive%2F2012%2Fnovember%2F20121120prresults%2F" target="_blank">stemming the spread</a> of HIV across the globe, but when crushed up and smoked as whoonga, they can destroy lives. Users say the street drug creates intense feelings of ecstasy and euphoria &#8212; at least some of which may be attributable to the ARV drug efavirenz, according to new research.</p>
<p>This high comes at an enormous cost. According to experts, prolonged use can lead to stomach ulcers, internal bleeding, and excruciating withdrawal symptoms. When Sipho doesn't get his fix, his mother says, he can turn into a monster.</p>
<p>"He becomes mad," Sarah says. "He screams and shouts, and has hit me and my husband already when we tried to keep him at home and not go with the other boys."</p>
<p>Media reports have identified efavirenz as a critical component to whoonga, citing hospital robberies and anecdotes from former dealers. Known in the US by its brand name Sustiva, efavirenz is widely acknowledged as one of the most effective first-line medications in suppressing HIV, and is typically prescribed in conjunction with at least two other drugs. It's also readily available in South Africa, where the government supplies efavirenz free of charge for poor HIV patients.</p>
<p><q class="left">Side effects could explain recreational use</q></p>
<p>Many have expressed doubts about the illicit use of efavirenz, citing inconclusive evidence on its psychoactive effects, but recent research suggests that the drug may be more potent than previously believed.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedaily.com%2Freleases%2F2013%2F04%2F130421153837.htm" target="_blank">study</a> presented late last month, Dr. John Schetz, a professor of pharmacology and neuroscience at the University of North Texas, found that efavirenz stimulates the same brain receptors that hallucinogens such as LSD act upon. His team's findings, currently under peer review, may explain why some efavirenz users experience side effects including night terrors, hallucinations, and suicidal depression; they may also explain whoonga's purported appeal to recreational drug users.</p>
<p>"The reasons patients experience these neuropsychiatric side effects are probably the same reasons people want to use [efavirenz] recreationally," Schetz said in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>.</p>
<p>He notes that further research is needed to more fully understand the impact of smoking efavirenz, as well as the drug's interactions with other substances. Based on his findings, though, he says efavirenz "almost definitely" has additive effects, enhancing the impacts of marijuana or heroin.</p>
<p><img alt="Durban_slum" class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2585615/durban_slum.jpg" /><br id="1367851741734" /></p>
<p><small>A township outside Durban, South Africa</small></p>
<p>Quintin van Kerken, director of the Anti-Drug Alliance of South Africa, says there's no doubt that addicts are lacing marijuana and heroin with ARV medicines, though it's difficult to gauge how pervasive the practice has become. The South African government does not keep official records on whoonga abusers, and many provinces don't have the resources to conduct chemical analyses of seized supplies.</p>
<p>A 2011 <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-e.org.za%2Fnews%2Farticle.php%3Fuid%3D20033064" target="_blank">study</a> from the University of KwaZulu-Natal found only scant traces of ARV medicines in seized whoonga samples. But Dr. David Grelotti, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health, says that as a synthetic street drug, its composition likely varies according to a number of factors.</p>
<p><q class="right">"we don't really know what's in whoonga all the time."</q></p>
<p>"There's probably no confusion that whoonga is abused in South Africa, but there is uncertainty because we don't really know what's in whoonga all the time," Grelotti said in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. "What's in whoonga probably varies depending on what's available when it is being made."</p>
<p>"HIV medications are added to whoonga," he affirms, "but we don't have any idea how consistently this is happening."</p>
<p>Whoonga use isn't as nationally prevalent as crystal meth, though the drug appears to have taken more of a foothold in South Africa&#8217;s poor and predominantly black townships &#8212; particularly in the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, where peddlers sell whoonga for between 20 and 40 rands a joint (roughly, between $2 and $5). More recently, it's begun spreading to the economic hub of Johannesburg, as well.</p>
<p>In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa's <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F07%2F20%2Fworld%2Fafrica%2F20circumcision.html%3Fscp%3D3%26amp%3Bsq%3Dkwazulu-natal%26amp%3Bst%3Dcse" target="_blank">most AIDS-stricken province</a>, there have been <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfgate.com%2Fhealth%2Farticle%2FAIDS-drugs-stolen-in-South-Africa-for-whoonga-3164946.php" target="_blank">reports</a> of dealers robbing HIV patients of their medication as they exit treatment centers, in addition to nighttime thefts of hospital ARV supplies. Others procure the drugs through less violent means, offering to purchase medications from destitute patients or corrupt hospital workers.</p>
<p><q class="left">"It&#8217;s very much a poverty issue."</q></p>
<p>"Gangsters or dealers offer money to people who are HIV positive, many of whom come from poor rural areas," van Kerken explains. "And they accept it, because at the end of the day, they need to feed their families. It&#8217;s very much a poverty issue."</p>
<p>Experts say hospital robberies and patient muggings have thus far had little effect on AIDS drug supplies. As of 2009, an estimated 5.6 million South Africans were infected with HIV, more than any other country. In recent years, the government has embarked on a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2F2010-12-01%2Fsouth-africa-starts-to-make-progress-in-campaign-against-aids.html" target="_blank">massive anti-AIDS campaign</a>, expanding testing centers and subsidizing medical costs for its poorest citizens. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fgamapserver.who.int%2FmapLibrary%2FFiles%2FMaps%2FHIVPrevalenceGlobal_2005%28August06%29.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Who" class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2585471/who.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Cathy Vos, national coordinator for the government-funded South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (SANCA), acknowledges that hospital robberies have occurred in recent years, though she describes them as "isolated incidents." She also expresses skepticism about the psychoactive effects of efavirenz, arguing instead that dealers may have successfully tricked addicts into believing the drugs boost the high they get from whoonga &#8212; a sort of underworld experiment in placebo marketing.</p>
<p>But Whoonga may still pose a fatal risk for those using it. Late last year, Grelotti coauthored <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flaninf%2Farticle%2FPIIS1473-3099%2812%2970294-3%2Ffulltext" target="_blank">an article</a> in <em>The Lancet</em>, in which he argued that efavirenz abusers could soon become resistant to the drug. Should they later contract HIV, any treatment may be rendered ineffective.</p>
<p>"Resistance to efavirenz can develop relatively easily," Grelotti explains, saying such resistance "could compromise the whole treatment."</p>
<p><q class="right">"We worry and ask God to bring him back."</q></p>
<p>As he and others are quick to point out, efavirenz abuse should not be seen as a reason to abandon the drug altogether. It remains one of the most effective HIV treatments available, and one of the cheapest. Whereas doctors in the US could easily switch to alternative medicines, those in South Africa and other developing nations don&#8217;t have many other options.</p>
<p>"We must take great care not to blame patients for this problem," Grelotti says, noting that doing so would only exacerbate the stigma from which many HIV patients already suffer. "We should instead double our efforts to provide people with the care that they need."</p>
<p>He and others say doctors should be more stringent about handing out efavirenz, and that further research is needed to more fully understand the scope of its abuse. Until action is taken, the Molefes and other whoonga-stricken families can do little more than urge addicts to seek rehabilitation, and hope for the best.</p>
<p>"The family are scared of him. We all are," Sarah says of her troubled son. "He sometimes does not come home for many days. We worry and ask God to bring him back."</p>

<p>Some Android users swear by task-killing apps, but most feel that the OS has matured to a point where you can let it manage itself without the need to meticulously close every open app on your phone. That hasn't stopped German automaker Audio, of all companies, from releasing its own task-killer app called <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.audi.app.startandstop" target="_blank">Audi Start-Stop</a>. Just like dozens of apps before it, Start-Stop notifies you when it detects open apps that aren't actively being used &#8212; once you tap the notification, the Start-Stop gives you a whole list of apps you can kill at your discretion.</p>
<p>Of course, Audi isn't really all that serious about app development &#8212; this new app is really little more than a way to promote <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.audi.com%2Fcom%2Fbrand%2Fen%2Ftools%2Fadvice%2Fglossary%2Fstart-stop-system.browser.html" target="_blank">the company's stop-start technology</a> found in its cars. That feature will automatically shut off a car's engine when it is stopped and restart it when the driver depressed the clutch to put the car back in gear. While start-stop sounds like a potentially useful feature for automobile drivers looking to save gas, Audi's Android app feels much more like a gimmick than something that'll actual save precious battery life for those who install it.</p>

<p>Of all the issues facing the world right now that the US government is concerned about, the sun may seem to be an odd one. But the White House is taking the threat of a massive solar eruption seriously. Late last month, it released a new, largely overlooked <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fblog%2F2013%2F04%2F26%2Fstanding-watch-against-space-weather" target="_blank">report outlining the risks of solar eruptions</a> when they strike the Earth &#8212; including the potential to cause massive, months-long power outages affecting upwards of 130 million people in the US alone, in one worst-case scenario. Still more troubling, the report &#8212; prepared by space weather experts from multiple government agencies &#8212; found that while the US is currently equipped with some of the best machinery for monitoring and forecasting such events, budget cuts over the next decade could put the country "at risk of losing critical capabilities that have significant economic and security impacts."</p>

<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="right">"The potential for the sun to unleash the big one is there."</q></p>
<p>"The potential for the Sun to unleash the big one is there," said Michael Bonadonna, the report&#8217;s lead author and executive secretary for the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nswp.gov" target="_blank">National Space Weather Program</a>, the agency in charge of coordinating these solar monitoring efforts. "It&#8217;s not a question of &#8216;if?&#8217; but &#8216;when?&#8217; and &#8216;are we ready?&#8217;"</p>
<p>"The big one," that Bonadonna refers to is an extreme version of a regularly occurring type of solar event known as <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsolarscience.msfc.nasa.gov%2FCMEs.shtml" target="_blank">"coronal mass ejection," or CME</a>, for short. Starting in the Sun&#8217;s outer atmosphere (corona), a CME is a powerful blast of billions of tons of solar gas and parts of the Sun&#8217;s magnetic field, which fly toward Earth at around a million miles an hour. Such <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsolarscience.msfc.nasa.gov%2FCMEs.shtml" target="_blank">CMEs thin out</a> as they travel through space over days, and by the time they arrive at our planet, most of them go unnoticed, causing only relatively minor disturbances to our planet&#8217;s own magnetic field.</p>

<p>Every 11 years, the sun enters its cyclical period of increased activity called <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsunearthday.nasa.gov%2F2013%2Fsolarmax%2F" target="_blank">solar maximum</a>, raising the potential for CMEs up to every few days. During this time, there is a heightened chance of especially powerful CMEs with magnetic fields pointed in the opposite direction of Earth&#8217;s. When one of these CMEs reaches our planet, it can cause a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasa.gov%2Fmission_pages%2Fsunearth%2Fnews%2Fstorms-on-sun.html" target="_blank">geomagnetic storm</a>, ripping away part of Earth&#8217;s own magnetic field in the atmosphere and rearranging it. These violent storms can last for days, and result in the beautiful sight of the Northern or Southern Lights (auroras), but can also damage several critical technological systems, including GPS, other satellites, airline radio communications and yes, electrical power grids on the ground. As it turns out, the Sun is expected to enter its period of increased activity this year, though so far, it's been a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasa.gov%2Fmultimedia%2Fimagegallery%2Fimage_feature_2464.html" target="_blank">relatively quiet one.</a></p>

<p><q class="left">"Who uses space weather? Almost everyone."</q></p>
<p>The space weather prediction center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) is in charge of forecasting the intensity of these events, using a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.swpc.noaa.gov%2FNOAAscales%2Findex.html%23GeomagneticStorms" target="_blank">scale from G1 to G5</a> (higher is worse), and warning all of the industries that might be affected. "The fact is, we&#8217;re almost at a point where if you ask the question &#8216;who uses space weather services,&#8217; my answer is almost everyone," said William Murtagh, program coordinator for NOAA&#8217;s space prediction weather center, also a coauthor of the new report. Murtagh pointed out that even the pipeline industry was at risk of being affected by solar events because pipelines themselves are electrically conductive.</p>
<p>Murtagh&#8217;s job is to deliver space weather warnings, especially those of geomagnetic storms, to other industries in time for them to take action and avoid heavy damage. Because of that information, industries have managed to avoid damage to their systems from the lesser G1 to G4 storms that have occurred over the years. Murtagh said the success of this program explains why even when there are dire reports of solar flares and storms in the mainstream media, they often don't result in any perceivable damage to the public at large. "After the event happens, the media says 'nothing happened. But with space weather, something's always happening." When it comes to the G5, or "great geomagnetic storms," it's unclear that information alone would be enough to mitigate their effects. As Murtagh told <em>The Verge</em>, "We sometimes refer to them as &#8216;Space Weather Katrinas.&#8217;"</p>
<p><q class="center">"we sometimes refer to them as &#8216;Space Weather Katrinas.&#8217;"</q></p>
<p>In order to forecast these events well in advance and alert those affected to get out of the way or turn equipment off, space weather experts rely on a long list of specialized instruments on the ground and in the sky, all of which could suffer maintenance issues if their budgets are slashed, as the report notes. But two are of particular importance: the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasa.gov%2Fmission_pages%2Fsoho%2F" target="_blank">SOHO spacecraft run by NASA and ESA</a>, which contains coronagraphs, instruments capable of imaging the area of the Sun where CMEs are born. The other is a NASA spacecraft called the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.srl.caltech.edu%2FACE%2F" target="_blank">Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)</a>, which is parked a million miles away from Earth in the direction of the Sun. ACE measures solar wind and can provide an hour&#8217;s notice of a CME hitting the Earth.</p>
<p><img alt="Nasa-soho-spacecraft" class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2585919/NASA-soho-spacecraft.jpg" /><small>The SOHO spacecraft before its launch in 1995. Credit: <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsohowww.nascom.nasa.gov%2Fgallery%2FSpacecraft%2Fsoho_photo7.html" target="new">NASA/ESA SOHO</a>.</small></p>
<p>"That&#8217;s our warning buoy," Bonadonna said of the ACE spacecraft. "That&#8217;s the fire alarm going off saying &#8216;get out of the house.&#8217;" Meanwhile, "if we were to lose that SOHO spacecraft, we lose that ability to forecast geomagnetic storms," Murtagh said. But while both spacecraft have been extremely reliable so far, they were launched in the mid- to late-1990s, and could give out at any time. A replacement spacecraft for ACE called DISCOVR is due to launch in 2014, and while several other craft have already been launched to succeed SOHO, none can provide its full capabilities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, studies have found that while massive geomagnetic storms are rare, they are a real and imminent risk, with as much as a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fwiredscience%2F2012%2F02%2Fmassive-solar-flare%2F" target="_blank">12 percent chance</a> of one occurring in the next decade, according to some studies. The most recent geomagnetic storm to cause any significant damage to the Earth occurred in 1989, when one <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasa.gov%2Ftopics%2Fearth%2Ffeatures%2Fsun_darkness.html" target="_blank">knocked out power for nearly the entire province of Quebec, Canada</a>, plunging six million people into darkness for nine hours. For power grids, the danger comes from surges that can overload and permanently damage their equipment. It&#8217;s this risk that space weather experts are most worried about. As the new White House-commissioned report notes, potential "consequences on the nation&#8217;s power grid are even higher [than other industries], with potential costs of $1-2 trillion that could take up to a decade to completely repair."</p>

<p>"The power distribution industry runs on a very fine line now," Bonadonna told <em>The Verge</em>. "They need to watch it [solar activity] very closely and make sure it doesn&#8217;t become a problem. But they have done a very good job in the last several years of making improvements." Such improvements include systems to harden power grids and make them more resilient against power surges, and to identify which areas are more at risk. As it turns out, not all areas of the world are equally affected by a geomagnetic storm: power stations closer to the poles are at greater risk, as are those located in areas where the surrounding ground minerals are more electrically conductive.</p>
<p><q class="right">"the consequences would be catastrophic to the nation."</q></p>
<p>There are two main camps when it comes to how big of risks a geomagnetic storm would pose to power companies . The worst-case scenario was first solidified in a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.nasa.gov%2Fscience-news%2Fscience-at-nasa%2F2009%2F21jan_severespaceweather%2F" target="_blank">2008 report funded by NASA</a>. It found that 365 high-voltage transformers out of a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2F2012%2F08%2F04%2Fus-solar-superstorm-idUSBRE8721K820120804" target="_blank">total 2,100</a> could be at risk if the most severe type of geomagnetic storm were to occur. "The conclusion was that the consequences would be catastrophic to the nation," Murtagh said. "There could be power outages extending from New England, down the mid-Atlantic coast, over to Chicago, affecting tens of millions, with recovery measured in months and years." Murtagh said that this 2008 report caught the attention of the White House and lawmakers in Congress, who called for the new report to be drafted.</p>
<p>But a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nerc.com%2Ffiles%2FGMD_Workshop_Report_April_2011.pdf" target="_blank">2011 report from the North American electrical grid industry organization NERC</a> did not agree that there were this many transformers at risk during a massive geomagnetic storm. There may be some attempt to reconcile the difference in opinion soon, at an <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eissummit.com%2F" target="_blank">electrical grid security summit</a> set for May 20th in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Still, whatever happens, there&#8217;s no telling when the next nightmare scenario might strike. It might be a G5 storm on the order of 1989 Quebec, or it might be worse: In 1859, the "<a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.nasa.gov%2Fscience-news%2Fscience-at-nasa%2F2008%2F06may_carringtonflare%2F" target="_blank">Carrington event</a>" was a geomagnetic storm so powerful it caused auroras as far south as Cuba and overloaded the dominant communications system of the time, the telegraph, shocking operators, sending sparks flying and even lighting some small fires. Fast forward 154 years, and the effects of a similarly sized solar storm would be far worse, say Murtagh and Bonadonna. "If you lose dozens of transformers or more and are dealing without power for months or even a year, that&#8217;s a totally different challenge to society, to survive an outage like that," Murtagh said.</p>

<p>Google has been putting serious work into building a full ecosystem on iOS, and today it's adding a couple of much-needed tweaks to Gmail in an <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgmail-email-from-google%2Fid422689480%3Fmt%3D8" target="_blank">App Store update</a>. Instead of bringing up a web page inside Gmail when the user clicks a link, it will open the separate Chrome app instead, adding a "Gmail" button that will let them get back to mail quickly. The same goes for other types of links &#8212; map or video links will open in Google's Maps or YouTube apps instead of in a browser window. All three of these can be turned off in the app's settings menu. Google has also changed Gmail's sign-in settings, so people with multiple accounts can sign out of a single one instead of making a universal departure. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F27%2F4153218%2Fgmail-for-ios-update-lets-you-swipe-to-move-between-messages">As with Gmail 2.1</a>, this isn't the kind of <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F12%2F4%2F3728548%2Fgmail-2-0-ios-hands-on">massive update we saw in December</a>, but it's a nice fix for email power users, as well as another way for Google to link its iOS portfolio together.</p>

<p>Aereo has filed a complaint against CBS in an effort to prevent the network from filing additional lawsuits against the fledgling service.</p>
<p>Aereo is a web TV service that enables users to view over-the-air broadcasts via the web. Two groups of television networks &#8212; groups that include CBS, Fox and NBC &#8212; filed copyright claims last year and argued that Aereo is an illegal service because it distributes their programming without compensating them. After losing two decisions in New York this year, a CBS spokesman said on Twitter that the CBS plans to file another lawsuit against Aereo in Boston, an area Aereo recently moved into.</p>
<p>"Last year, the trial court denied CBS&#8217;s and the other broadcasters' request for a preliminary injunction against Aereo," Aereo said in a statement. "Last month, the appeals court affirmed that decision. The fact that CBS did not prevail in their efforts to enjoin Aereo in their existing federal lawsuit does not entitle them to a do-over in another jurisdiction. We are hopeful that any such efforts to commence duplicative lawsuits to try to seek a different outcome will be rejected by the courts."</p>

<p>Hulu Plus launches for Windows Phone 8 today, representing Microsoft's latest major "get" in the company's continued push to fill out its app catalog. Like Pandora earlier this year, the streaming video service has long been available on competing smartphone platforms iOS and Android. But Microsoft and Pandora managed to deliver a polished final product nonetheless &#8212; one arguably better than any competing version of the app &#8212; and Hulu has clearly received equal focus and attention. After you've signed into the premium subscription service, you'll notice that every section of the app is incredibly fluid and responsive. Videos queue up quickly (which obviously can vary depending on how solid your data connection is), playing in HD resolution on our Lumia 920 with no signs of stuttering. Closed caption support is also available for supported titles.</p>
<p><q class="center">'Better late than never' is the story of Windows Phone's app ecosystem</q></p>
<p>Everything you'd expect from Hulu Plus is here, and navigating around the app proves quick and efficient. TV shows, clips, movies, trailers, queues, favorites, and a kid-friendly section are all helpfully linked from the main menu. The company's deal with Criterion is also placed front and center, with classic films separated into categories like "spectacular set design" and actor-specific portals ("Totally Trintignant").</p>

<p>Unfortunately whereas Microsoft managed to pull some strings and give its users an ad-free Pandora experience, the pre-roll ads Hulu subscribers have grown familiar with are in full effect here. They're never overly annoying, and the company's financial upswing suggests viewers are willing to put up with these quick interruptions over traditional cable commercials.</p>
<p>Hulu Plus will undoubtedly help Microsoft further round out its Windows Phone app ecosystem. It took a long time to get here &#8212; <em>too</em> long by any measure &#8212; but in the end users should be more than satisfied with what's been delivered here. It's available as a free download from the Windows Phone Store today. Now, about Instagram...</p>

It got its <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.cnbc.com%2Fquotes%2FMTGOXUSD" target="_blank">own ticker on CNBC</a> and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F73379%2Freal-money-starts-to-pour-into-math-based-currencies-like-bitcoin%2F">inspired a legion of startups</a>. And yet, we still don&#8217;t know where it came from.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was first introduced to the world by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, a persona that communicated by email and in the official Bitcoin forum before abruptly disappearing. No one has ever met him, or at least no one who will admit to it. No one knows if Nakamoto is male or female. His (or her) early emails even <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mail-archive.com%2Fcryptography%40metzdowd.com%2Fmsg09959.html%2520target%3D">refer to a "we."</a></p>
<p><q class="right">"It's all part of the fun."</q></p>
<p>Both <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Freporting%2F2011%2F10%2F10%2F111010fa_fact_davis%2520target%3D"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2F1785445%2Fbitcoin-crypto-currency-mystery-reopened" target="_blank"><em>Fast Company</em></a> tried and failed to unmask Nakamoto. The <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcointalk.org%2Findex.php%3Ftopic%3D58770.0" target="_blank">ongoing crowdsourced investigation</a> hasn&#8217;t done any better. "People analyze Satoshi's written words, trying to divine if he speaks native British English, American English, or learned the language as a second language," said Jeff Garzik, a developer who works on the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoin.org%2Fen%2F" target="_blank">Bitcoin Project</a> and emailed with Nakamoto in the early days."They analyze his posting dates, trying to guess his local time zone. It's all part of the fun."</p>
<p>But two weeks ago, programmer Sergio Demian Lerner discovered something new about Nakamoto.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is designed to mimic gold in some ways. Anyone can "mine" for new Bitcoins by running the Bitcoin client. The process is designed to <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F11%2F16%2F3649784%2Fbitcoin-mining-asics-block-reward-change">get more difficult</a> as more people start mining. At first, the client could create 50 Bitcoins in an hour running on an average laptop. It now takes a day to generate three Bitcoins using a powerful machine that does nothing else.</p>
<p>It was generally assumed that Nakamoto has been mining Bitcoins since the very beginning and probably owned a large amount. But if Lerner&#8217;s analysis is correct, Nakamoto is likely hoarding an eye-popping fortune of almost a million Bitcoins, worth more than $100 million at today&#8217;s market price.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin protocol creates a public ledger as Bitcoins are generated and exchanged, which produces a receipt for every transaction and prevents coins from being spent twice. By examining this ledger, Lerner deduced that Nakamoto has only spent around .0005 percent of his fortune, or about 500 Bitcoins, over the last four years.</p>
<p><q class="center">Nakamoto is likely hoarding an eye-popping fortune of almost a million Bitcoins</q></p>
<p>There is some disagreement over whether Lerner&#8217;s numbers are correct, but the experts <em>The Verge</em> consulted all said the basic gist was accurate: there is an entity that has amassed a large fortune in Bitcoin, and that entity is probably Nakamoto. "Sergio's latest detective work is technically sound," Gavin Andresen, the Bitcoin developer who took over for Nakamoto, said in an email. "It sure looks like one person (or group of cooperating people) mined about a million bitcoins in 2009, and the most likely suspect is Satoshi."</p>
<p>Bitcoin was introduced to the world in 2008 in an academic paper that was <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mail-archive.com%2Fcryptography%40metzdowd.com%2Fmsg09959.html" target="_blank">emailed to the Cryptography and Cryptography Policy Mailing List</a>. Nakamoto started emailing with individual programmers who took an interest, and then began <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcointalk.org%2Findex.php%3Faction%3Dprofile%3Bu%3D3%3Bsa%3DshowPosts" target="_blank">posting on the Bitcoin forum</a>. His communications were overwhelmingly technical, never personal, and always in text.</p>
<p>In April of 2011, Nakamoto <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fmagazine%2F2011%2F11%2Fmf_bitcoin%2F" target="_blank">emailed Andresen</a> to say that the Bitcoin Project developers "should try to de-emphasize the whole &#8216;mysterious founder&#8217; thing when talking publicly about Bitcoin." No one has heard from him since.</p>
<p>Lerner&#8217;s analysis includes more information than has ever been revealed about Bitcoin&#8217;s elusive inventor. It also provides a new starting point for those who want to discover Nakamoto&#8217;s real identity. The Nakamoto-entity did make some transactions, each of which has the potential to reveal more clues. Lerner noted this in a blog post <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fbitslog.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F04%2F17%2Fthe-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto%2F" target="_blank">announcing his findings</a>. "If the real name of the sender of a single transaction belonging to the entity is identified, then Satoshi&#8217;s mystery identity will be revealed," he wrote. "I bet that this will happen in the days following this post." (It hasn&#8217;t, yet: the difficulty of tracing transactions back to a name is one of Bitcoin's most popular features.)</p>
<p><q class="left">By Bitcoin logic, Nakamoto&#8217;s identity shouldn&#8217;t matter</q></p>
<p>But by Bitcoin logic, Nakamoto&#8217;s identity shouldn&#8217;t matter. Bitcoin was designed to substitute technology for trust. "What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party," Nakamoto wrote in the original Bitcoin white paper.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t change the fact that people still want to know.</p>
<p>"I&#8217;m as curious as I was back then, probably even more curious," said Joshua Davis, who spent four months trying to find Nakamoto for a piece in <em>The New Yorker</em> in October 2011. "Every time I see a news post about the rise of the value of the Bitcoin, I wonder if Satoshi is seeing that too. What&#8217;s he thinking? Is he proud? Is he thinking that, at some point, some day, he&#8217;ll finally reveal himself? Imagine 15, 20 years down the line. The world has now really adopted Bitcoin. It is a viable currency. At that point will Satoshi, on his death bed, say, &#8216;It was me&#8217;?"</p>

<p>It's no secret that the Wii U isn't selling with, with <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F24%2F4260062%2Fnintendo-2012-earnings">Nintendo's bottom line</a> suffering as a result. Unsurprisingly, the company is looking for new ways to invigorate sales, and a new <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.japantimes.co.jp%2Fnews%2F2013%2F05%2F06%2Fbusiness%2Fnintendo-taps-smartphone-apps-for-console-boost%2F%3F%23.UYe1dCtARPT" target="_blank">report from <em>The Japan Times</em></a> indicates that Nintendo may be looking to smartphones for inspiration. Apparently, Nintendo is producing and offering software to game developers that would let them build smartphone games that can also be played on the Wii U. The company feels that the console has a lack of compelling software and it is hoping that it can quickly grow the Wii U's library though this new initiative, which would presumably result in a new fleet of less expensive games. While details around this plan are minimal, it's pretty clear that Nintendo needs to try something new to turn the Wii U around. 2012 was the second consecutive year the company lost money, and its newest console has only sold 3.45 million units around the world so far &#8212; quite a bit fewer than the 5.5 million Nintendo originally predicted.</p>

<p>For a little over a month, I've been getting off my subway one stop early and walking the rest of the way home. I've been playing soccer twice a week, and trying to drink eight glasses of water every day. I've been running more, eating better, and still not sleeping nearly enough.</p>
<p>I've been testing the Fitbit Flex, the first fitness wristband from the company that deserves a lot of credit for popularizing wearable fitness devices in the first place. From its namesake Fitbit Tracker to the newer One and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2011%2F10%2F11%2F2483968%2Ffitbit-uitra-review">Ultra</a>, the California-based company has typically been known for devices that clip to your shirt or your pants and track your every movement. But every Fitbit user seems to have a tale of a lost or accidentally machine-washed tracker, so the company came out with the Flex. It's a $99 bracelet that purports to help you be more active, eat better, sleep better, and become far more attractive to the opposite sex. (One of those isn't <em>strictly</em> true, but it kind of is.)</p>
<p>But you could fill both your arms with all the available gadgets that claim to do those things. From Jawbone to Nike to Samsung to even a slew of apps for your phone, there are a million and counting ways to track your activity. So what does Fitbit offer that makes it special? Why should you spend $99 on the Flex over <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F11%2F27%2F3694856%2Fjawbone-up-review-fitness-band-2012">an Up</a> or <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F3%2F8%2F2853088%2Fnike-fuelband-review">a FuelBand</a>, or <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fmoves%2Fid509204969%3Fmt%3D8">a free iPhone app</a>? After lots of exertion in the name of journalism, I think I have an answer.</p>

<p>Instagram is the ubiquitous service that everyone thinks of when they talk of mobile photography, but its rise to fame wasn't without intrigue. Kara Swisher has written a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fbusiness%2F2013%2F06%2Fkara-swisher-instagram" target="_blank">lengthy piece for <em>Vanity Fair</em></a> that details the inauspicious beginnings of the company, to its various investment deals and finally, its famous billion dollar acquisition by Facebook. It's a good read for anyone interested in following the lore of Silicon Valley, or for other aspiring entrepreneurs that are still looking to nab their own big pay days.</p>

        <p>Look up in the sky! It&#8217;s a bird! It&#8217;s a plane! It&#8217;s&#8230;. a Superman infographic! Today&#8217;s graphic from <a href="http://mashable.com/" target="_blank" title="Mashable">Mashable</a> gives us a look at the history of one of America&#8217;s oldest and most iconic superheroes: the Man of Steel himself, Superman. Anyone who is familiar with his character likely knows some of Superman&#8217;s backstory already; his origins on plant Krypton, his weakness to Kryptonite and his long-standing struggle with arch nemesis Lex Luthor are all well-known bits of knowledge in Superman lore. Possibly a lesser-known fact about the Clark Kent / Lex Luthor struggle is that it originally began when the two of them were teenagers in the same town. </p>
<p>Superman is very thoroughly established in our fiction and popular culture, so it should be no surprise that he&#8217;s set to show up on the big screen again next month in &#8220;Man of Steel.&#8221; After Superman&#8217;s initial comic book success, the character really took off and began to branch out into mediums like TV shows (both animated and non-animated) and an entire series of films. </p>
<p>For more info on Superman&#8217;s history and future take a look at the graphic below. [<a href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/21/superman-history-infographic/" target="_blank" title="Via">Via</a>]</p>

<p><strong>What follows is not deja vu, it&#8217;s the top 10 best selling apps on Ubuntu for the month of April (2013, for readers from the future).</strong></p>
<p>Yes, for the fourth month in a row there is no change at the top of the chart. The $2.99 desktop weather application Stormcloud,&#160;<a href="http://www.omgchrome.com/stormcloud-for-chrome-weather-made-beautiful/" target="_blank">which recently launched on the Chrome Web Store</a>, remains Ubuntu&#8217;s best selling app.&#160;<b style="font-family: Raleway, Ubuntu, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;"><br />

<p>Stormcloud sold&#160;<em style="font-family: Raleway, Ubuntu, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">182</em>&#160;copies during April &#8211; 40 sales up on that shifted in March, taking its 2013 total to 695 copies.</p>
<h3>Elsewhere in the chart</h3>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just the top of the chart that seems in stasis there&#8217;s also little change&#160;lower down the ladder.</p>
<p><strong><em>Filebot</em></strong>, <em><strong>Fluendo,</strong> <strong>Braid</strong></em> and <strong>&#8216;War in a Box: Paper Tanks&#8217;</strong>&#160;continuing to sell, with the latter three just changing by a single place on last months rankings.</p>
<p>There are two new entries: indie game <strong>Splice</strong> &#8211; best described as &#8216;Sudoku in a Petri Dish&#8217; &#8211; charts at #4, and&#160;<strong style="font-family: Raleway, Ubuntu, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">Uberwriter</strong> &#8211; a lightweight markdown text editor &#8211; clinches #6.</p>

        <p>vnstat is a <i>very</i> tiny command line tool, showing you stats of your used data via the internet.<br /><br />

It shows you the stats for every month as well as for yesterday and today. It also estimates how much data you could spend in the rest of the day/month.<br />
<br />
rx stands for your downloaded data (receive), tx for your uploaded data (transmit), the rest is self-explanatory.<br />
<br />
It seperates between your WLAN-Connections (wlanX) and Ethernet-Connections (ethX), where X = number.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

But this is just the basic function. To get the list showing all the stuff you can do with vnstat, type 
vnstat -? 
into the terminal.<br />
<br />
To install it, type into the terminal:
<code>
sudo apt-get install vnstat</code>
To start vnstat, type the terminal command 
vnstat.

<p>It&#8217;s been a full 5 months since the release of Luna Beta 1 and we&#8217;ve been hard at work to bring you the next beta. elementary has received tons of positive feedback from happy users all over the world. We&#8217;ve also received a flood of testers and bug reports. We&#8217;re happy to announce that we&#8217;re ready to release our second beta with over 300 fixes! Here are a few of the big ones:</p>
<h2>Internationalization</h2>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" class="borderless c2" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/preferences-desktop-locale.png" /></p>
<p>Since elementary is used and developed by people from all over the world, it only makes sense for us to focus on making it available in as many languages as possible. After Beta1 was released, we were pleasantly surprised to see a HUGE translation team spring up out of nowhere! We&#8217;ve been working with them to bring better translation support to all of our apps, including our app development framework Granite. We&#8217;ve also added better support for Sinhalese fonts as well as Khmer fonts.</p>
<h2>Multiple Display Support</h2>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" class="borderless c2" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/display.png" /></p>
<p>While most default setups are single-display, we do have a lot of power users who use multiple displays. As such, we&#8217;ve worked at making multiple-display support even better in Luna. Specifically, we&#8217;ve solved a number of bugs with Plank and Wingpanel in regards to appearing on the correct display and setting this in System Settings.</p>
<h2>Visual Enhancements</h2>
<p>Our user experience designers have been especially hard at work putting the finishing touches on Luna. Since our recent rebranding by the very talented Ian Hex, we&#8217;ve had a strong focus on providing great typography. Because of this, we&#8217;ve made sure to include an updated version of our title font &#8220;Raleway&#8221; that brings more font weights. We&#8217;ve also focused in on fixing the appearance of monospace fonts in the OS and as a bonus we&#8217;ve made some very cool new creative fonts available as an extras package.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" class="borderless c3" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/switch_0.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>elementary theme</strong> has seen even more enhancements since Beta 1. We've added more focus states for accessibility (a subtle blue glow when your keyboard is focused on a widget), cleaned up the inline toolbars, improved tab styling, reworked spin-buttons, switches, and more. We've really been working on refining the smallest details of the theme this cycle and tracking down visual bugs. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Felementaryos.org%2Fjournal%2Felementary-gtk-theme-33-released">Read More</a></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" class="borderless c4" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/lightdark.png" /></p>
<p>Our <strong>icon set</strong> has also seen a number of updates this cycle, from the panes in System Settings to a brand new set of emoticons and completely redrawn Folders, you&#8217;ll see a big difference in quality from beta1 to beta2.&#160; <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Felementaryos.org%2Fjournal%2Fnew-folder-icons-luna">Read More About Folders</a></p>
<h2>Updated Apps</h2>
<p class="rteleft"><img alt="" class="borderless c5" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/shotwell.png" /></p>
<p>Photo enthusiasts will be pleased to find the latest <strong>Shotwell</strong> 0.14.1 present in Beta 2. This release brings a number of stability fixes, better facebook integration, improved support for RAW, and many more small fixes. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.yorba.org%2Flucas%2F2013%2F04%2F1139.html">Read More</a></p>
<p class="rteright"><img alt="" class="borderless c5" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/midori.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Midori</strong>, our web browser, has been updated to version 0.5. It features better Granite support, improved responsiveness and functionality in autocomplete, improved extension loading, a reworked (and now extend-able) downloads backend, a new Cookie Security Manager, and a slew of bug fixes. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ftwotoasts.de%2Findex.php%2F2013%2F04%2Fhigh-five%2F">Read More</a></p>
<p><img alt="" class="borderless c5" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/multimedia-audio-player.png" /></p>
<p>When testing Beta 1, many potential switchers complained about the code name of our flagship music player. So in addition to the update to version 0.2, Noise is now called&#160;<strong>Music</strong>. We've improved album art handling, added duplicate-detection, and added the number of remaining tracks in the queue to the source list. We also pushed out some UX/design updates, improved external device support, and greatly improved performance. Lastly, we fixed a huge amount of crashers that were affecting users since Beta 1; thank you for everyone who reported these and helped us make Noise rock. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elementaryos.org%2Fjournal%2Fnoise-02-released">Read More</a></p>
<p class="rteright"><img alt="" class="borderless c5" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/internet-mail.png" /></p>
<p>The ever popular <strong>Geary</strong> has been updated to version 0.3.1, which includes support for multiple accounts, marking mail as spam, &#8220;collapsed&#8221; messages in conversations, and tons of fixes. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.yorba.org%2Fchaz%2F2013%2F03%2Fgeary-0-3-released.html">Read More</a></p>
<p><img alt="" class="borderless c5" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/utilities-terminal.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Terminal</strong> was updated to version 0.2. We implemented bug fixes, improved customizability, and added a few new features like color schemes and zoomable text.</p>
<h2>Keyboard Workflow</h2>
<p>While we often focus on the improvements we&#8217;ve made for less-experienced users, we also want to highlight the things we do to make life a little easier for our pro users. So for Beta 2 we&#8217;ve made keyboard-based workflows much better. You can now move windows with &#8984; + click-n-drag. Tab switching is a bit more keyboard friendly. Quit and Close shortcuts should work as expected in Noise and for our fancy light windows. Searching should be more immediately available across our apps (no need to click the box first, just type!).</p>
<h2>More</h2>
<p>In addition to the numerous changes above, we&#8217;ve fixed up a lot of odds and ends. With Switchboard&#8212;our system settings app&#8212;we&#8217;ve added the ability to switch dock themes, included brand new Keyboard and Power sections, and fixed up the way indicators and other places can launch Switchboard. Contractor&#8212;our system-wide extension service&#8212;was actually completely reworked to fix provide more accurate matching and greater functionality for contract developers. We fixed an annoyance in WingPanel that made indicators change their order. By popular request, we&#8217;ve added lights that show when windows are open to the dock. Like Music, we've changed Maya to Calendar. Lastly, we now support UEFI installs.</p>
<p>Overall, what we see in Beta2 is a faster, more stable, more beautiful, more accessible, more international, and even easier to use and feature rich elementary OS.</p>
<h2>How to Help</h2>

<p>elementary OS is crafted <strong>entirely by volunteers</strong>. We happily accept any help offered to us from the community. There are a number of ways you can help out and make the final release even better.</p>
<p>First of all, go ahead and make sure you're&#160;<a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.launchpad.net%2F%2Blogin" target="_blank">registered with Launchpad</a>. We use Launchpad for blueprint planning, code hosting, and bug tracking; it&#8217;s a tool that is very useful for us and is essential for testers to use.</p>
<h3>Report Bugs</h3>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" class="borderless c5" src="http://journal.elementaryos.org/sites/default/files/user/6/apport.png" /></p>

<p>What happens if you come across a bug? Report it! We&#8217;re pushing out this beta to allow wider testing before we release a final version, and it&#8217;ll only get better if we know about any bugs that might exist. There are a number of ways to report bugs.</p>
<p>First, if something crashes, look for the "Report a Problem" dialog which should pop up. If you encounter a bug without that happening, go ahead and click the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Felementaryos.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fuser%2F5%2Fapport-128.png%22%3E"></a>. This will log some system information (crash reports and app logs), let you check over the contents, and then upload it to Launchpad to a private bug. You can also report bugs about a specific app from it's "About" dialog (found in the gear menu). Launchpad will open in your browser where you can double-check the bug and <strong>give us more details so we can fix it</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not in elementary OS but still need to report a bug, you can simply visit Launchpad in your browser and report the bug on our project page. No matter how you report a bug, be sure you&#8217;re including any information about what you were doing before the bug occurred so we can successfully track it down.</p>
<h3>Join Development</h3>

<p>We&#8217;re always happy to meet new developers. If you&#8217;re a developer or tester interested in helping elementary more closely, <strong>join #elementary on irc.freenode.net</strong>. We can talk with you and help direct you toward a project you could play a big role in.</p>
<p>There is also the elementary Developer Community <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flaunchpad.net%2F%7Eelementary-dev-community" target="_blank">mailing list</a>, where developers can ask questions, propose or brainstorm ideas, and discuss development in a non-real-time fashion. It&#8217;s a great place to introduce yourself as a developer and find a project to help with.</p>
<p>After Beta2 comes RC1, we&#8217;ll be targeting any new bugs toward <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fbugs.launchpad.net%2Felementaryos%2F%2Bmilestone%2Frc1" target="_blank">this</a> milestone on Launchpad. It might be a good idea to familiarize yourself with that milestone and even try tackling some bugs as they pop up.</p>
<h3>Translate</h3>
<p>elementary OS is targeted to and used by people from all over the world. If you speak more than one language, you could be invaluable to ensuring that someone who doesn't speak English gets to enjoy elementary. Check out <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslations.launchpad.net%2Felementary">our translations page</a> on Launchpad and look for apps that need translations in your language.&#160;</p>
<h3>Donate</h3>

<p>Last but not least, you can <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Felementaryos.org%2Fdonate" target="_blank">donate to elementary</a>. We&#8217;re 100% volunteer and rely on donations to fund things like the website, travel expenses to developer conferences (where we meet incredible people, learn valuable new things, and make friends with other projects), and anything else that furthers our mission. Every little bit counts and we offer multiple ways to donate like credit card, flattr, and PayPal.</p>
<h2>How to Download/Install</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve read about all of the work that&#8217;s gone into this beta and how to help us out, you probably want to know how to download and install it.
