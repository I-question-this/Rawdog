In this video, we see a very thin ferrofluid drop on a pre-wetted surface just as a uniform perpendicular <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/magnetic+field">magnetic field</a> is applied. Immediately the droplet <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/droplet+breakup">breaks up</a> into tiny isolated peaks that migrate out to the circumference. The interface breaks down from center, where the drop height is largest, and moves outward. Simultaneously, the <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/diffusion">diffusion</a> of ferrofluid from the circumferential droplets into the surrounding fluid lowers the magnetization of those droplets, making it more difficult for them to repel their neighbors. As a result, they drift outward more slowly and get caught by the faster-moving droplets from within. (Video credit: <a href="http://web.it.nctu.edu.tw/~chingyao/">C. Chen</a>)</p>

<p><em>Upstream Color</em>, the beautiful and acclaimed indie sci-fi film from <em>Primer</em> director Shane Carruth, is still showing in a few theaters, but it's now available for everyone as a download or DVD. Carruth has <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ferbpfilm.com%2Ffilm%2Fupstreamcolor" target="_blank">released <em>Upstream Color</em> for download</a> on a variety of platforms, including iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play; while it's $14.99 on these sites, you can also spend $5 more for a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwatch.erbpfilm.com%2Fbuy%2Fupstream_color" target="_blank">DRM-free stream or download</a> through his studio's site. A combination DVD / Blu-ray bundle is also for sale, with access to the download included.</p>
<p><em>Upstream Color</em> premiered just a few months ago at Sundance Film Festival, and it's seen an extremely limited theatrical release since then; in <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F10%2F4208658%2Finterview-shane-carruth-upstream-color-primer">an interview with our own Ross Miller</a>, Carruth discussed plans for using digital distribution to make it available to a wider audience. Despite (or because of) its cult popularity, his first film <em>Primer</em> proved difficult to find until it began showing up in digital form online; it got its own <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F11%2F29%2F3706086%2Fshane-carruth-primer-movie-direct-distribution">DRM-free release</a> late last year. For <em>Upstream Color</em>, that's happened much more quickly. If you haven't had the chance to see the film yet, you can <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F22%2F3903524%2Fupstream-color-review-shane-carruth-sundance">check out our review from Sundance</a> here.</p>

<p>Microsoft is updating its YouTube application for Windows Phone on Tuesday in a significant way. Previously, the app was simply a web link to the mobile YouTube interface, but it's not a full application for Windows Phone 8 devices. You can now access videos, channels, playlists, and pin them to the Windows Phone 8 Start Screen. Microsoft is also supporting YouTube accounts, allowing you to access your uploads, playlists, and video lists.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Nine Inch Nails <em>Broken</em> film &#8212; an oft-bootlegged, never officially released, snuff-style music video collection &#8212; was <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F6%2F4305438%2Funderground-nine-inch-nails-snuff-film-finally-officially-released">officially released for the first time</a> on Vimeo after existing for two decades as an underground oddity. In just over two hours, Vimeo had deleted the video for its highly explicit depictions of violence, but the flood of attention from the video&#8217;s release and subsequent deletion certainly got the attention of the NIN organization. "I didn't expect it to be such a big deal since it's been on The Pirate Bay for years," <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rob-sheridan.com%2F" target="_blank">NIN art director Rob Sheridan</a> told <em>The Verge</em>. "But, I tend to forget that apparently not everyone seeks out snuff films on torrent sites."</p>
<p><q class="left">"I tend to forget that apparently not everyone seeks out snuff films on torrent sites."</q></p>
<p>Indeed, Sheridan and the NIN team were hardly trying to shock the internet with <em>Broken&#8217;s</em> official release &#8212; he says that its release was just another step in his work trying to share as much of the band&#8217;s history online as possible. "I've realized that I'm so involved with NIN that I started to just assume everyone has seen everything that's been released, but that's not the case at all, especially when you have a band with a 25-year history," he said. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F2%2F25%2F4027734%2Freinvented-nine-inch-nails-to-return-this-summer">NIN&#8217;s impending return this summer</a> provided the impetus needed to reinvigorate the band&#8217;s online presence and to make classic and forgotten material readily available, with some of the content being quite rare and new to a younger generation of fans. "It's been fun to post old classics like <em>Closure</em> (a 1997 concert and music video collection originally released on VHS) on our Tumblr and Facebook and see the reaction from kids who didn't even know it existed," Sheridan said.</p>

<p>Of all the rare material at Sheridan&#8217;s disposal, there&#8217;s no doubt that the <em>Broken</em> video represents the pinnacle &#8212; a relic of a time when all of a band&#8217;s creative material wasn&#8217;t readily available on YouTube or BitTorrent. And despite the fact that the video&#8217;s content is undoubtedly disturbing, <em>Broken&#8217;s</em> swift deletion by Vimeo was still a bit of a surprise. "When you have mainstream &#8216;torture porn&#8217; movies all over the place now, this just didn't feel as dangerous anymore," said Sheridan. He also hoped that Vimeo, which has a reputation for being a more artistic and creative version of YouTube, would be the right place for the video. "The music industry lawyers haven't figured out Vimeo yet and we can safely upload whatever we want over there," Sheridan notes &#8212; but <em>Broken</em> was still over the line.</p>
<p><q class="center">"Maybe having it tucked away on a pirate site is the closest modern equivalent to finding a bootleg VHS copy at a head shop in the '90s."</q></p>
<p>The video&#8217;s deletion is something Sheridan appears to take some pride in &#8212; he has a fond appreciation for its underground status and was noncommittal at the thought of hosting the video on NIN&#8217;s official site, free from Vimeo&#8217;s terms of service. "Honestly, maybe this was never meant to be so easy to watch," he said. "Maybe having it tucked away on a pirate site is the closest modern equivalent to finding a bootleg VHS copy at a head shop in the '90s." Sheridan delved into that murky history in a post <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Frobsheridan.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F49787212383%2Fwhen-i-was-a-teenager-this-was-a-thing-of" target="_blank">on his personal blog</a> when the video was released yesterday. "When I was a teenager, this was a thing of forbidden wonder &#8212; the type of underground, alt culture urban legend that isn&#8217;t technically possible anymore," Sheridan wrote. "Kids today can&#8217;t possibly appreciate the feeling of tracking down a rare video artifact, because everything now is a mere Google search away."</p>


<p><q class="right">"I just hope we never completely lose the dark crevices of the Internet."</q></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting conflict for NIN &#8212; the band is well known for its openness online and its creative use of the internet to engage with fans, but there&#8217;s also a longing for a bygone age when artists and musicians were more of a mystery. "I think by and large music has benefited tremendously from the internet &#8212; but mystique has definitely suffered, says Sheridan. "Before the internet, you didn't know anything about your favorite bands except what you were able to gather from interviews in magazines or videos on MTV. Rock stars were mysterious and inaccessible. Now you know what they had for lunch every day."</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s little doubt that NIN will continue sharing and connecting with its fans through the internet when the band returns, Sheridan sounds content &#8212; even reassured &#8212; with the experience he had trying to get <em>Broken</em> out of the dark corners of the internet and its place a curiosity found on shady BitTorrent tracker sites. "I just hope we never completely lose the dark crevices of the internet &#8212; the weird, unsupervised, questionably-legal places where content like this can still live," he says "That's the Wild West internet I grew up with. It's quite fitting, really, that <em>Broken</em> should live there."</p>

<p>24 hours after Hulu Plus finally <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F6%2F4304688%2Fhulu-plus-windows-phone-8-now-available">made its debut on Windows Phone 8</a>, Microsoft's users have another reason to be excited: Foursquare just unveiled a brand new app for the platform. Designed from the ground up in close collaboration with Microsoft and Nokia, the latest iteration of Foursquare has been "tailored for the Metro UI" according to a blog post from the company. Design-wise, the app looks fairly slick and uncluttered&#8212; though we haven't yet taken a stroll around the city with it just yet. Foursquare says that in addition to resources contributed by Microsoft and Nokia, its own internal engineering and product teams played a significant role in building the app.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the partnership with Nokia is more than skin deep, with Foursquare for Windows Phone 8 optimized for the latest crop of Lumia hardware. "Some of the Lumia models even integrate Foursquare data into their augmented reality experience," the post reads, giving owners of supported handsets a nice bit of immersive (and exclusive) functionality. Or as Foursquare puts it, "it feels like you're in the future when you're finding cool places." Nokia is also keen on showcasing the collaboration. Moving forward, Foursquare will come pre-loaded on "some" Lumia-series Windows Phone 8 devices.</p>
<p>If you're still lagging behind with Windows Phone 7, fear not: Foursquare says an updated version of its WP7 app will ship in a few weeks and provide a "similar experience" to what Windows Phone 8 users are getting today.</p>

        <p class="itembyline">

        <div>
<p>The one bright spot for apartment hunters over the past decade has been the emergence of online aggregators like Zillow, Trulia, and StreetEasy, which scrape property listings from around the web and organize them in one place. &#8220;StreetEasy, especially, has been killing it,&#8221; says <em>Curbed</em>&#8217;s Steele. &#8220;It&#8217;s a real godsend if you&#8217;re looking to find clean, reliable property listings.&#8221; For a small fee, StreetEasy will even show apartment seekers how much an apartment and comparable properties have rented for in the past. &#8220;Comps are an invaluable tool for consumers who want to get the best price.&#8221; says Steele. &#8220;The problem is, once you find a place you like, these search sites just pass you off to a random broker, with no guarantee of honest service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urban Compass aims to marry this kind of search technology with its own in-house brokerage force. Allon&#8217;s first search engine, Orion, scoured the enormity of the world wide web, and is now part of Google&#8217;s core search algorithms. His second company, Julpan, kept tabs on the torrent of real-time messages coursing through social networks, and is now part of Twitter's search. By comparison, the apartment rental market in New York City five boroughs, with a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nakedapartments.com%2Fblog%2Fnyc-rental-market%2F" target="_blank">little over two million total units</a> and just a few hundred new listings per day, seems like a rather small and slowly shifting data set.</p>
<p>The company has also employed a small army of agents over the last six months, each equipped with a brand new iPhone, to pound the pavement, verifying apartments in person, snapping photos, and marking locations with geotags. It currently has 30 brokers, which it calls neighborhood specialists, and plans to hire 100 by the end of the year. &#8220;We are going to launch with an almost comprehensive database of apartments in Manhattan, from open listings to exclusives,&#8221; says Allon.</p>
"We&#8217;re not just building a brokerage. Real estate is just the first application."
<p>Despite Allon&#8217;s ambitions, getting every apartment in the system may not be possible. New York, unlike almost every other state in the nation, doesn&#8217;t require all available properties to be be publicly listed through what is known as a multiple listing service, or MLS. &#8220;It&#8217;s anti-competitive and at some point it will get struck down, but right now, that&#8217;s the lay of the land, and it makes it a lot harder to disrupt incumbent players who have built up relationships with landlords over decades,&#8221; says Steele.</p>
<p>So while there is a ton of pain in the market for consumers, the real power for change lies with the sellers, the landlords, who have very little incentive to change. &#8220;Why should 80-year-old Donna, who happens to own a couple dozen great properties, learn to work with some complex new technology?&#8221; asks Steele. &#8220;Her apartments have been renting just fine. She&#8217;ll keep right on working with the brokers she knows, and they will do business as usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, the antiquated nature of the rental market, with some landlords still faxing new listings in to their favorite brokers, is something property owners may want to protect. &#8220;The idea of having more transparency is not something landlords are necessarily going to be interested in,&#8221; says RealDirect&#8217;s Doug Person. &#8220;If they rented an apartment on the third floor last week for $2,700 a month, but the market has tightened, and now they want to rent same apartment on the fifth floor for $3,500, that is not something they want buyers to be aware of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in 2006, the BBC took 250 engineers and locked them into several rooms in a mansion. But this wasn't the scene for an epic horror movie: instead, it set the stage for researchers to group together and focus on a number of projects. The BBC had a stack of ideas, but it "didn't really know what to do with them," explains Alia Sheikh, director of BBC R&amp;D Production Labs. "We did the math and we worked out that if we split everyone up into teams of five and took an idea off the stack, and then locked those five people into a room for a week, they could work on an idea &#8212; we pretty much had enough ideas to do a whole year."</p>
<p>So Sheikh and her team kept the managers away and shipped in pizza to ensure the researchers were focused on creating some unique projects. At the end of the week, each group had to demonstrate their findings to the department. One of the ideas, simply named "Surround Video," was part of the weeklong experiment. Sheikh describes it as "surround sound for your eyes" and she told her team to simply "go build it" before leaving them to it. "What they came back with was really interesting, it was a way of extending your traditional TV experience." The idea centers on having your normal television in a living room and then projecting additional video onto the surrounding walls.</p>

<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="left">After locking engineers in a room, the result is impressive</q></p>
<p>The result is rather impressive. I got a chance to experience it firsthand during an unveiling <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fabout%3Ablank" target="new">at the British Film Institute recently</a>. The system, which requires about an hour of calibration in a new room, uses a standard HD projector with a fish-eye lens that bounces off a nearby mirror. It mimics the eye's natural tendency to focus on details at the center of our vision, while picking up movement in our peripheral vision. That's exactly how Sheikh and her team have approached creating content for such a system.</p>
<div class="gallery inline" id="gallery4071895">
<h3><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F7%2F4307854%2Fbbc-surround-video-research-photos">BBC Surround Video research&#160;photos</a></h3>

<p>Sheikh's team got permission to put a camera in front of a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train to film a continuous shot. For the demonstration, I sat at the very center of a sofa in front of a large-screen television with images projected around the TV and on the nearby walls. I couldn't escape the projections unless I looked behind me. Passing over the train tracks through London's East End provided a real sense of immersion, and the changes in lighting as we passed under structures was a good illustration of how this technology could be applied in the future. There were some minor drawbacks, though. The seating arrangement wasn't ideal, as my head eclipsed the projector and cast a shadow below the TV. It spoiled the experience slightly, until I learned to ignore it and focus on what was around me.</p>
<p><q class="right">The BBC shot a film designed for Surround Video</q></p>
<p>Another issue was in the level of detail. Unfortunately, the pixels in the projection were clear, an issue that was particularly evident when Sheikh's team demonstrated a frame-by-frame animation. Unfortunately that segment lacked the graphic motion required to pull the effect off well. I found myself staring at pixels rather than focusing on the content itself. Animation does seem like a natural fit for this particular technology, but it requires motion to work well. That's something the BBC is investigating, and in 2011 it shot a film exploring how directors would need to capture content for a future projection system.</p>

<p>Sheikh found that using a Steadicam or set of dolly tracks were essential to capture the right motion shots for the best results. The film's director had to shoot his subjects four meters away, and the demands that went along with using two cameras &#8212; one focused on the actor with the other capturing a fisheye of the surroundings &#8212; made it tricky to film in certain circumstances. A Steadicam operator would have to carry an uncomfortable 88 pounds of equipment. Dolly tracks worked well, but the fish-eye lens on one camera often picked them up. There are certainly challenges filming surround content, and until this is addressed fully it holds back the viability of such a system in the home.</p>
<p><q class="center">It's not IllumiRoom, but the BBC is happy with Microsoft's own research</q></p>
<p>Microsoft has stolen the limelight recently with its own <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F30%2F4285166%2Fmicrosoft-illumiroom-xbox-projector-interview">research into an "IllumiRoom" projection system</a> that expands gaming content beyond the realm of a TV display and onto living room walls. The software maker's primary focus is gaming right now, with speculation that such a system might debut as part of Microsoft's next-generation Xbox plans. But the company has also said that IllumiRoom could be used to augment film and TV.</p>
<p>"I'm really glad that people are actually now doing work in that space ... We've seen Microsoft is doing something very similar," says Sheikh. "To be honest, it's quite cheering because this was an experiment we did years ago." The BBC research team is now experimenting with high frame rates and playing around with technology to see how immersive future TV experiences can get. "To see other people looking at something very similar from a gaming point of view ... the more work that happens in this space the happier I'll be."</p>

        <p>This post is from <a href="http://www.chromestory.com">Chrome Story - Chrome Is What You Make Of It</a></p><p>Google has released an official Chrome packaged app for Google Keep. The app is a packaged app, which is &#8220;native&#8221; app for Chrome and Chrome OS. This is a quick post to spread the news and share the download link.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The Google Keep Chrome app launches in its own window, so you can create notes, cross out your to-do lists, and attach photos to tasks while you work on other things. And if you don&#8217;t have an internet connection, don&#8217;t fret: the Chrome app works offline because we all know that ideas (big and small) can be sparked at any time</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Since this is a native app for Chrome OS, it works really fast. You can add notes, lists and pictures just like the web app or android app. It is stored locally and synced to the server in real time. If you are offline, the app waits for a working connection to upload your notes.</p>

<p>Stanford Professor Andrew Ng is bringing back the idea of an artificial intelligence that can think like a person. With Google's Deep Learning project, he's creating machines that take a multi-layered approach to information, building up knowledge and figuring out concepts by passing data between various networks that can each recognize a small piece of it. The approach is designed to mimic how the human brain processes information with neural networks, and it's starting to work &#8212; last year, Google's "brain" figured out how to identify cats in YouTube videos without being told that the concept of "cat" existed. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fwiredenterprise%2F2013%2F05%2Fneuro-artificial-intelligence%2Fall%2F" target="_blank"><em>Wired</em> has profiled Ng</a> and his work on brain-like computers, a project that also ties into current <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F28%2F3924332%2Feuropean-commission-funds-graphene-and-human-brain-project">government-funded brain mapping projects</a> in the US and Europe.</p>

<p>It's rare to actually witness a meteorite falling toward Earth. Only 1,042 meteorites were observed and recorded during the past 4,500 years, even though across the planet over 34,000 have been found. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fbolid.es%2F" target="_blank">A new visualization</a> by designer Carlo Zapponi highlights the wonder of catching glimpse of such an event. The interactive animation creates a timeline of every meteorite that has been seen falling since 861 AD, building out details on each instance, including the mass, weight, and material of the fallen debris, as well as a link to view where it landed on a map.</p>
<p>Zapponi titled the visualization <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fbolid.es%2F" target="_blank">Bolides</a>, after a type of extremely bright, fireball-like meteorite. The graphic's data comes from The Meteoritical Society, a nonprofit that studies planetary science, but the organization doesn't gather the information firsthand. Instead, it collates the data from other sources, the majority of which comes from the Natural History Museum in London, while additional details from several scientific organizations are used to fill in any gaps. Researchers are now using automated devices to detect meteorites, but even in recent years, witnessing their fall remains an elusive event.</p>

<p>The online map wars have taken an interesting turn lately, with <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F8%2F30%2F3279775%2Fgoogle-map-maker-google-plus-support">Google</a> and its rivals <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fhere.com%2Fmapcreator%2F31.78642758224501%2C44.322328999999996%2C2%2C0%2C0%2Chybrid.live" target="_blank">Nokia</a> and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F9%2F27%2F3416396%2Fapple-races-the-clock-maps-issues">Apple</a> all turning to their users to try and crowdsouce improvements in their main global map data. But a lesser-known, crowdsourced project called <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.openstreetmap.org%2F" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> &#8212; sometimes referred to as the "<a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Ftheobserver%2F2012%2Ffeb%2F18%2Fopenstreetmap-world-map-radicals" target="_blank">Wikipedia of maps</a>" because it is a map built entirely from volunteer contributors around the world, without a corporate overlord &#8212; is aiming to lure casual users into its fold, too. Today, it's launching a new editor "<a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fideditor.com%2F" target="_blank">iD</a>," which users voted to add as the default option for the website.</p>

<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p>The iD editor represents the most dramatic facelift for OpenStreetMap since the project first started back in 2004. Imagine <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelp%3AEditing" target="_blank">Wikipedia's complicated, esoteric interface for editors</a> being overhauled to make editing articles as easy as posting something on <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftag%2Ftumblr">Tumblr</a>, and you'll have an idea of what the new iD editor is like for OpenStreetMap users.</p>

<p>"We want new users to be able to start mapping within minutes," said Eric Gundersen, CEO of <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fmapbox.com%2F" target="_blank">MapBox</a>, a DC-based startup company that took the lead in developing the new editor, working with OpenStreetMap contributors over a seven-month period. MapBox uses OpenStreetMap data for its own paid map products, including the maps it provides for <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F3%2F1%2F2835722%2Ffoursquare-open-street-map-web-version-drops-google-maps-api" target="_blank">Foursquare's website</a>.</p>
<p><q class="right">"We want new users to be able to start mapping within minutes."</q></p>
<p>Gundersen said that the new iD editor would also help improve the map quality for Foursquare and other major tech brands that have turned to OpenStreetMap data instead of Google Maps data in recent years &#8212; including <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F6%2F11%2F3078987%2Fapple-tomtom-openstreemap-ios-6-maps-app" target="_blank">Apple</a> and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F4%2F7%2F2931320%2Fwikipedia-updates-mobile-apps-drops-google-maps-for-openstreetmap" target="_blank">Wikipedia itself</a>. These companies have transitioned to OpenStreetMap data in part because it is completely free under an open database license, unlike Google Maps, which charges for heavy usage of its Maps API (<a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fmaps%2Ffaq%23usage_pricing" target="_blank">25,000 loads or more</a>). "We think you're going to see a lot more companies putting time into improving the core OpenStreetMap data," Gundersen said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, right now, the new iD editor for OpenStreetMap is still not quite so easy as to eliminate the learning curve for complete newbies. Currently restricted to desktop Web view, the iD editor is definitely a vast improvement over the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.openstreetmap.org%2Fwiki%2FBeginners_Guide_1.3.2" target="_blank">previous default editor</a> for OpenStreetMap, which was intimidatingly technical. iD has an interactive guided tutorial, and it is about on par with the ease of <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fmapmaker" target="_blank">Google Map Maker</a> and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fhere.com%2Fmapcreator%2F31.78642758224501%2C44.322328999999996%2C2%2C0%2C0%2Chybrid.live" target="_blank">Nokia's HERE Map Creator</a>, but neither of those systems are all that intuitive, either.</p>

<p><q class="left">"We're going to get this on a tablet."</q></p>
<p>Still, MapBox promises improvements to iD for OpenStreetMap coming later this year, and Gundersen said his company was working on making iD work on mobile devices soon, too. "We're going to get this on a tablet, getting this on mobile devices is going to be huge," he told <em>The Verge</em>. MapBox first embarked on its quest to build the new editor in September 2012 with a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fallthingsd.com%2F20120920%2Fopenstreetmap-gets-first-major-funding-from-knight-news%2F" target="_blank">$575,000 grant</a>, and says that it still has some money leftover to continue further refinement of the product now that it's launched.</p>

<p>Wireless internet provider Boingo offers specialized apps for every major phone or computer platform, but iOS users now have the moderate advantage of being able to sign up almost instantly through their iTunes account. The latest version of <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fboingo-wi-finder%2Fid297596317%3Fmt%3D8" target="_blank">Boingo Wi-Finder for iOS</a> includes the option to buy Wi-Fi as an in-app purchase, rather than getting access with a Boingo account. Unlike the general <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boingo.com%2Fwifi-plans%2Fmobile%2Fboingo-mobile%2F" target="_blank">$7.95 Boingo mobile subscription</a>, the plan appears to be iOS-only, with unlimited use on the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch for $7.99 a month.</p>
<p>The goal is pretty clearly to lower the barrier to making Boingo payments &#8212; the above pop-up message appears the first time you launch the app, asking if you want to set up a recurring monthly subscription. For users who don't want the plan, it's still possible to sign in with an ordinary Boingo account, but it's a quick and decent option for iOS aficionados who are planning long-term use.</p>

        <p>It is harder than hard to choose just one of these quotes, but that is what I am going to do because that is what I have set out to do.</p>
<blockquote><p>I meant what I said and I said what I meant.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find myself questioning things I have said to people, wondering whether or not they were childish, self-centered, or worse, untrue. An example that keeps playing out in my mind is, &#8220;You&#8217;ll never meet anyone like me.&#8221; Whatever confidence I had at that time has since been replaced with pure embarrassment. <em>Why would I say that? How eager and conceited I must have sounded! </em>The truth is, they will never meet someone like me because I am who I am, and I am like no one else. Sometimes we need Dr. Seuss to remind us of these things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a quote aficionado. I eat them for breakfast, for my mid-morning snack, my lunch, dinner, and sometimes back to back. That&#8217;s the truth of all truths&#8211;ask anyone I know. For a person so hungry for words, you might expect my favorites to lie in the wisdom of Emerson, Austen, or even Twain, but I can gleefully say that no one can top my man, Dr. Seuss. Suess would sling words of wisdom as if he were reading headlines from the Sunday paper. Can you do that? Seuss would say &#8216;yes.&#8217; Check out this infographic. I mean exactly what I say when I say, you will love it. [<a href="http://www.mamiverse.com/dr-seuss-quotes-19331/" target="_blank">via</a>]</p>

        <p>Many have reported that they have not been able to watch flash videos in Midori. This quick tutorial shows how to enable flash in the default elementary browser.
<center><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UzbxMzrMxtE/UYg4nfm7d-I/AAAAAAAABrw/UcKlB8hRS7A/s1600/midori.png"><img border="0" class="summary" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UzbxMzrMxtE/UYg4nfm7d-I/AAAAAAAABrw/UcKlB8hRS7A/s320/midori.png" /></a> </center>
In the terminal paste the following lines:
<code>
sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer<br />
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/flashplugin-alternative.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so<br />
sudo apt-get install nspluginwrapper<br />
nspluginwrapper -v -a -n -i<br />
</code>
Although this hack works for most people, I still was not able to watch <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> through Midori. If any has found a workaround, let us know in the comments!
<br /><br />
Thanks to G&#233;rald Maruccia for the tip!

        <p>The Perrin numbers have a definition analogous to Fibonacci numbers. Define <em>P</em><sub>0</sub> = 3, <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> = 0, and <em>P</em><sub>2</sub> = 2. Then for <em>n</em> &gt; 2, define</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>P</em><sub><em>n</em>+3</sub> = <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> + <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em>+0</sub>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3709104440/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=3709104440&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theende-20">The Concrete Tetrahedron</a> says</p>
<blockquote><p>It appears that <em>n</em> is prime &#8220;almost if and only if&#8221; <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> mod <em>n</em> = 0.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;only if&#8221; condition is true without qualification: if <em>n</em> is prime, <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> mod <em>n</em> = 0. It&#8217;s the &#8220;if&#8221; part that&#8217;s almost true. When <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> mod <em>n</em> = 0, <em>n</em> is <strong>usually</strong> prime. Composite numbers that satisfy the Perrin condition <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> mod <em>n</em> = 0 are called Perrin pseudoprimes. The smallest Perrin pseudoprime is 271,441. The next is 904,631.</p>
<p>There are only 17 Perrin pseudoprimes less than a billion. By comparison, there are 50,847,534 primes less than a billion.</p>
<p>So if you used the Perrin condition to test whether numbers less than a billion are prime, you would correctly identify all&#160;50,847,534 primes as primes. But out of the 949,152,466 composite numbers, you would falsely report 17 of these as prime.&#160; In other words, you would be 100% accurate in identifying primes as primes, but only 99.999998% accurate in identifying composite numbers as composite.</p>

        <div>
<p>Rovio's games &#8212; particularly the <em>Angry Birds</em> series &#8212; have propagated across a wide variety of mobile devices, but unfortunately there's no way to keep your progress in sync. If you're an iPad and iPhone user, what you do on one device isn't reflected on the other, but Rovio's hoping to change that with the introduction of Rovio Accounts. It's a simple service that only requires an email address to sign up for, and once you've done so your progress will be synced across devices after signing in with that account. Rovio Accounts will also let multiple users save their progress on a shared device, something that'll certainly be useful for families with only one tablet.</p>
<p>t's a much-requested and potentially useful feature, but right now it is severely limited &#8212; Rovio Accounts work with <em>The Croods</em> globally and on the original <em>Angry Birds</em> in Finland and Poland. That's it &#8212; no <em>Angry Birds Space</em> or <em>Bad Piggies</em> syncing just yet. The company says it intends to continue rolling out this feature to other countries and games, but for now only players of <em>The Croods</em> will really be able to benefit from Rovio accounts.</p>

<p>To give users a better understanding of what people are watching, but also where they are watching it, Google has launched a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Ftrendsmap" target="_blank">new Trends Map</a> feature to "surface popular videos in real time, and provide context for trends" in the US. The map can be toggled to show what's popular with men or women, and display videos trending between different age groups. Videos are displayed based on the number of shares and views they receive in the past 12 - 24 hours, giving users an idea of what is popular on social networks and which videos have been viewed the most in that time &#8212; perhaps before they go viral. Google says the service is currently US-only, but asks non-US users to "stay tuned for future updates and explorations."</p>

<p>Jan Koum, CEO of WhatsApp, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2013%2F03%2F17%2Fmessaging-service-whatsapp-to-extend-subscription-model-to-ios-this-year-but-dont-hold-your-breath-for-a-desktop-app%2F" target="_blank">has no intention</a> of building an app for desktop computers. WhatsApp is arguably the most successful independent mobile messaging app in the world, so Koum's views have some credibility, but what if mobile is only one half of the messaging puzzle? Viber CEO Talmon Marco is betting big on the desktop with today's launch of Viber for PC and Mac. The app includes video chat and voice calls, like Skype, and syncs all your messages instantly with the company's mobile app across BlackBerry, Windows Phone, iOS, and Android. In a messaging world that feels increasingly mobile-first, Marco's hoping that building apps for every platform will win out. At 200 million users as of today, Viber's already off to a good start.</p>

<p>Viber for PC and Mac feels like a more modern version of Skype mixed with Messages for Mac. All of your contacts fill a left rail, while text and photo content are ordered chronologically on the right. You send text messages to friends, place voice calls, and also engage in video chats. Everything is synced instantly to Viber for mobile devices, which Apple's Messages still struggles with. While the app can't yet do conference calls or mobile-to-mobile video calls like Skype, it boasts some innovative features like the ability to pass off calls from desktop to mobile and vice versa with one tap. Marco is quick to point out, however, that Skype began on desktop while Viber began on mobile &#8212; a platform that he affirms is still the most important.</p>
<p><q class="center">Everything is synced instantly to Viber for mobile devices, which Apple's Messages still struggles with</q></p>
<p>Viber for PC and Mac is most impressive simply because it acknowledges that many of us sit in front of computers all day, so typing on a 3.5-inch screen isn't always convenient. Yes, there are several ways to message friends from a computer, such as email or IM, but few apps aside from Skype let you easily send rich forms of content and place calls. It seems increasingly likely that we'll have to choose between multiple ways to message friends &#8212; especially since most leading messaging apps seem content with operating only on mobile devices &#8212; but now that Viber's on Mac and PC (with Linux on the way), Marco hopes you want have to.</p>

<p>One of gaming's most iconic first-person shooter franchises will be revived later this year when Bethesda releases <em>Wolfenstein: The New Order</em>. The publisher announced the title today, tentatively setting a Q4 2013 shipping timeframe for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and next generation consoles. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Fnews%2Fwolfenstein-the-new-order-revealed-6407979%3Ftag%3DTopslot%3BSlot1" target="_blank">According to <em>Gamespot</em></a><em>,</em> <em>The New Order</em>'s story will take place in 1960s Europe; players will again assume the role of B.J. Blazkowicz as he wages war against Nazi forces. As the announcement trailer makes clear, however, the latest <em>Wolfenstein</em> isn't exactly grounded in reality. You'll be battling against and attempting to commandeer Nazi "super weapons," which include massive, weapon-toting robots by the looks of it. That's all we know so far, but we should have a much better understanding of <em>Wolfenstein: The New Order</em> by the end of this week; <em>Gamespot</em> will be releasing additional details on the game each day. In the meantime, catch the announcement trailer below.</p>

        <div>
<p>The popular RunKeeper fitness app on iOS and Android is finally getting the support for the Pebble smartwatch <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F5%2F2%2F2993660%2Fallerta-pebble-runkeeper-smartwatch-app">the two companies promised almost exactly one year ago</a>. With the update, Pebble owners will be able to see their pace and mileage on their watch face, along with the ability to start or stop a workout. Unfortunately, you'll still need to pull out your phone to get things started &#8212; launching the app on your phone automatically launches a companion app on the Pebble, at which point the two begin communicating with each other.</p>
<p>It's a nice extension for both Pebble and RunKeeper, but it's tightly-focused to RunKeeper's core mission as an app &#8212;RunKeeper is primarily thought of as an exercise tracker, not a more generalized health monitor. Similarly, either because of limitations in the Pebble or in the iOS and Android app APIs, this pairing won't let you replace your Fitbit or Fuelband with a Pebble. It's simply not tracking your every step because neither the watch nor the app are always reading your movements like other "wearables."</p>
<p>It's still early days in wearables and fitness apps, though, and RunKeeper in particular has been shrewd at making partnerships and working with other companies. Recent deals with Fitbit and Jawbone show that the company is willing to work within a larger ecosystem and that could mean it has a better shot than most at being a central hub for such data. Working with Pebble is also a good sign. Just four months past the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F11%2F3866204%2Ffitness-health-devices-ces-breakout">invasion of fitness trackers at CES</a>, it already looks like the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F11%2F3866228%2Fbody-request-give-me-back-my-data">fever of closed health data ecosystems</a> might have a chance of breaking.</p>

        <p>This simple and brief tutorial is going to show you how to remove the ugly white dots from the LightDM login screen in Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><a href="http://ubuntuguide.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/login-screen-with-dots.png"><img alt="login-screen-with-dots" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9256" height="281" src="http://ubuntuguide.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/login-screen-with-dots-500x281.png" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><a href="http://ubuntuguide.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/login-screen-without-dots.png"><img alt="login-screen-without-dots" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9259" height="281" src="http://ubuntuguide.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/login-screen-without-dots-500x281.png" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;re two ways:</p>
<p>1. Hit <b>Ctrl+Alt+T</b> to open terminal, copy and paste following 3 commands and run one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow user <i>lightdm</i> to create a connection to the X server:<br />
<code>sudo xhost +SI:localuser:lightdm</code></li>
<li>Switch to user <i>lightdm</i> in terminal:
<p><code>sudo su lightdm -s /bin/bash</code>
</li>
<li>Disable draw grid in unity greeter:<br />
<code>gsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-grid false</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. The second way is using the popular Ubuntu configuring tool Ubuntu-Tweak: <em>Tweaks -> Login Settings -> unlock -> turn off draw grid.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://ubuntuguide.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/turn-off-draw-grid.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8794" height="242" src="http://ubuntuguide.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/turn-off-draw-grid-500x242.png" title="turn-off-draw-grid" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Ubuntu Tweak is available at <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-tweak" target="_blank">launchpad.net/ubuntu-tweak</a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

The fonts don't look like that when using Cinnamon.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>What's new in Cinnamon 1.8</h2><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Cinnamon 1.8 no longer uses gnome-session for fallback which has advantages such as the ability to restart Cinnamon after a crash or the use of a wrapper which allows Cinnamon to restart itself after potential crashes. This should also fix the issue with Cinnamon not working on some hardware which was actually capable of running it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cinnamon 1.8 comes with its own Control Center</b>, so there's no longer the need to use GNOME Control Center. This is especially useful if you have installed multiple desktop environments: features that are GNOME Shell or Unity specific don't show up in Cinnamon Control Center, so you should now have a more clean, less confusing settings app.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In Cinnamon Settings you can find all the GNOME settings that also apply to Cinnamon as well as Cinnamon-specific settings such as applets, desklets, theme settings, windows behavior, hot corners setup, panel settings and more:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-system-settings.png" rel="image_group"><img alt="Cinnamon Control Center" src="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-system-settings_thumb.png" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">By default, Cinnamon Control Center displays only some of the system settings and for more advanced settings you must click the "Switch to Advanced Mode" button in the lower left corner.</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The <b>Cinnamon Screensaver</b> about which we were telling you <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2013/01/work-started-on-cinnamon-screensaver.html">a while back</a>, is available by default with Cinnamon 1.8. The screensaver is very simplistic, displaying the date and time on a shaded background and optionally, it can also display an away message:</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-screensaver.png" rel="image_group"><img alt="Cinnamon Screensaver" src="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-screensaver_thumb.png" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-screensaver-settings.png" rel="image_group"><img alt="Cinnamon screensaver settings" src="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-screensaver-settings_thumb.png" /></a></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The new Cinnamon release also introduces "<b>Desklets</b>" (<b>desktop widgets</b>), but since this is a new feature, there are only a few available for now:</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-desklets.png" rel="image_group"><img alt="Cinnamon Desklets" src="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-desklets_thumb.png" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-desklets-settings.png" rel="image_group"><img alt="Cinnamon desklets settings" src="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-desklets-settings_thumb.png" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The desklets can be set to snap to a desklets grid so they align nicely, with configurable grid width and users can also select if the desklets should use a border, border and header or no decoration at all.</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Another interesting new feature in Cinnamon 1.8 is that you can <b>install or update "spices" (which include applets, desklets, themes or extensions) directly from the desktop</b>, via Cinnamon Control Center, so Cinnamon users no longer need to manually download and install them from  http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com:</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-applets-install-online.png" rel="image_group"><img alt="Cinnamon 1.8 applets install" src="http://img.netupd8.com/cinnamon-1.8-applets-install-online_thumb.png" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">In my test, installing themes didn't work for some reason, maybe because the available themes aren't compatible with the latest Cinnamon 1.8 yet, but I was able to successfully install applets and desklets.</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">And finally, <b>Nemo, the default Cinnamon file manager, has received many improvements </b>since the previous stable release that's available in Linux Mint 14 (1.1.2), such as:</div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">buttons in the statusbar to easily hide the sidebar and switch between places and treeview (sidebar);</li><li style="text-align: justify;">option to hide the menu;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">collapsable sidebar categories;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">breadcrumbs;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Sidebar Disk Indicators: indicators are displayed under each drive, displaying the free/used space;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">various fixes and more.</li></ul><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

        <div>
<p>Recently released video of a police shootout in a Brazilian slum has ignited controversy in Rio de Janeiro, raising important questions about the city's crackdown on crime ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics &#8212; both of which will be hosted in Rio.</p>
<p>The black-and-white video, captured using heat-seeking technology last May, was recorded from a police helicopter during a pursuit of M&#225;rcio Jos&#233; Sabino Pereira &#8212; a 36-year-old convicted drug trafficker who went by the name "Mathematician." The helicopter tracks Mathematician through the densely populated slum of Favela da Cor&#233;ia, before unloading a torrent of bullets just as he entered a car. As the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F05%2F07%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fvideo-of-rio-hunt-for-drug-trafficker-raises-concern.html%3Fpartner%3Drss%26amp%3Bemc%3Drss%26amp%3Bsmid%3Dtw-nytimes%26amp%3B_r%3D0" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> reports</a>, some of these bullets hit buildings surrounding the car, though it's not clear whether any bystanders were injured. Mathematician's body was found a day later, with authorities calling his death a "resistance killing."</p>
<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p></p>
<p>In a statement issued at the time of the operation, Rio police justified the assault by claiming that Mathematician had fired on officers earlier in the day. But the issue came under renewed scrutiny this week, when Globo, a Brazilian news network, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fg1.globo.com%2Fjornal-hoje%2Fnoticia%2F2013%2F05%2Facao-policial-em-favela-do-rj-e-investigada-pelo-ministerio-publico.html" target="_blank">aired the full video</a> during a broadcast Sunday evening. Amid outcry from humanitarian groups and promises for further investigation, police are now acknowledging that they may have crossed the line.</p>
<p><q class="center">"This image leads us to admit that there could have been a disproportionate action."</q></p>
<p>"This image leads us to admit that there could have been a disproportionate action," Martha Rocha, head of Rio&#8217;s Civil Police, told the <em>New York Times</em>. But Adonis Lopes de Oliveira, the helicopter's commander, seemed to dismiss any risk of injury to civilians in an interview with Globo, telling the network, "That street was frequented largely by traffickers."</p>
<p>The controversy comes at a time of heightened tensions across Rio, where authorities have been furiously preparing for the upcoming World Cup and Olympic games. Most of their efforts have focused on the city's notorious favelas &#8212; expansive, crime-ridden slums controlled by druglords and militias. Some of the cleanup has been <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smithsonianmag.com%2Fpeople-places%2FA-Look-Into-Brazils-Makeover-of-Rios-Slums-183842911.html" target="_blank">welcomed by locals</a>, but other policies &#8212; including a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld-latin-america-13957096" target="_blank">campaign to demolish 3,000 homes</a> &#8212; have elicited greater outrage. It remains unclear whether this week's video will bring about any change in Rio's agenda, though officials will likely face more scrutiny in the months to come.</p>

<p>Changing the format of interactive games, Loveshack Entertainment's new Mac, PC, and mobile game puts the player in charge by asking them to move a series of panels to help tell a story. <em>Framed &#8212;</em> which will go on sale in the coming months &#8212; sets each scene using panels you'd normally associate with a comic book, providing the player with the tools to arrange and rearrange the storyboard to progress their character through the story. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F2013%2F5%2F6%2F4303114%2Fframed-putting-context-in-the-players-hands" target="_blank"><em>Polygon</em> takes an in-depth look</a> at the development of <em>Framed</em>, describing how it went from concept to reality, and why its makers hope that by giving players more freedom it can "nail interactive storytelling."</p>

        <div>
<p>Valve has begun testing new biofeedback technologies based on a player's sweat levels and eye movements, as part of the company's ongoing efforts to incorporate user emotions into gameplay. As <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fventurebeat.com%2F2013%2F05%2F05%2Fvalves-experimental-psychologist-discusses-sweat-detection-and-eye-tracking-for-games%2F" target="_blank"><em>VentureBeat</em> reports</a>, Mike Ambinder, Valve's resident experimental psychologist, discussed the developments at last week's NeuroGaming Conference and Expo, held in San Francisco.</p>
<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" />
<p>According to Ambinder, Valve has already begun conducting sweat-based experiments with the game <em>Left 4 Dead</em>, whereby researchers correlated a player's perspiration levels with his or her level of excitement. These data were then relayed to the game software, and gameplay was adjusted accordingly. If a user remained calm during a shootout sequence, for instance, the game would unfold normally. If he became nervous, however, the pace would speed up and the player would have less time to complete a given task.</p>
<p><q class="center">"It&#8217;s still experimental, but it worked pretty well."</q></p>
<p>The company has also developed a version of <em>Portal 2</em> that users can control using only their eyes. "It&#8217;s still experimental, but it worked pretty well, and we were pleased with that," he noted.</p>
<p>Valve has made no secret of its desire to incorporate biometrics and emotion into its gameplay experience. The company posted a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F4%2F13%2F2945691%2Fvalve-engineer-job-posting-hardware-design">job listing</a> for a psychologist last year, and CEO Gabe Newell stressed the importance of biofeedback during an <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F8%2F3852144%2Fgabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming">interview with <em>The Verge</em></a> at this year's CES.</p>
<p>It's not clear when any of these technologies will be ready for the market, but Ambinder says that deeper physiological integration could open up new frontiers in game interaction. "The more interesting side of the equation is what you can do when you incorporate physiological signals into the gameplay itself," he said last week. "If we could start tapping into that, we could tap into a whole wealth of data."</p>

        <div>
<p>Last week, SoftBank CEO dissected Dish Network&#8217;s competing bid for Sprint, calling it "<a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F30%2F4285174%2Fsoftbank-masayoshi-son-calls-dish-sprint-bid-misleading">incomplete and illusory</a>," but today he explained exactly why he thinks SoftBank is better poised than its competition to take control of Sprint: synergy. After introducing the company&#8217;s new summer phones at a carrier event in Tokyo, the CEO described networking advancements like the company&#8217;s interference-reducing single frequency network (SFN) technology, and how he believed that they, along with commitments to speed and signal quality, would translate to benefits at Sprint.</p>
<p><q class="left">"We're already using it on a large scale."</q></p>
<p>Fielding a question from a <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter, Son elaborated, saying that the synergies amounted to a significant difference in the assets that the competing companies brought to the table. He also took the occasion to remind everyone that the TD-LTE spectrum that Sprint <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F12%2F17%2F3775840%2Fsprint-clearwire-acquisition-purchase-softbank">stands to acquire from Clearwire</a> is the same band that SoftBank uses. "SoftBank 4G" TD-LTE service is "the first time in the world that this transmission method has been employed for commercial use, and we&#8217;re already using it on a large scale," the CEO explained.</p>
<p>Later, when pressed on exactly why he thought that having deployed 2.5GHz TD-LTE amounted to an advantage against Dish, Son explained that the big key in Sprint&#8217;s resuscitation would be its ability to quickly and efficiently utilize the spectrum. "The partner that&#8217;s able to make best use of it is clearly SoftBank," he quipped. Whether that&#8217;s enough to assuage worries about <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F1%2F4292208%2Fcharlie-ergan-responds-to-masayoshi-son-on-sprint-acquisition">potential lingual and cultural friction</a> at America&#8217;s third-largest carrier will be settled with a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F2%2F4293352%2Fsprint-clear-to-vote-on-softbank-buyout-after-sec-approval%2Fin%2F3285297">shareholder vote on the SoftBank proposal</a> in June.</p>
