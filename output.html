<p>Following weeks of rumors and an apparent <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F4%2F4299790%2Fnokia-lumia-928-billboard-leak-rumor">billboard ad</a>, Nokia has launched a teaser site for its upcoming Lumia 928 handset. The site doesn't reveal all the specifications and details about the Lumia 928, but it confirms the naming and follows a recent <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2013%2F05%2F07%2Fnokia-lumia-928-shows-off-in-magazine%2F" target="_blank">magazine ad</a> noting its launch on Verizon.The printed ad confirms the focus on the low-light abilities of the Lumia 928, with a mention of PureView, Nokia's optical image stabilization, and the typical Carl Zeiss lens.</p>
<p>Nokia CEO <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F18%2F4238174%2Fnokia-new-lumia-coming-later-this-quarter-ahead-of-a-season-of-new">Stephen Elop recently hinted</a> that a new Lumia would gain hero status at a major US carrier, and it appears the Lumia 928 launch is imminent. Nokia's image doesn't show the device fully, but it's consistent with previous leaks and looks similar to the company's Lumia 920 handset. Both Microsoft and Nokia are believed to be investing significant marketing resources into the new Lumia 928 launch, hoping to boost Windows Phone market share in the US.</p>

<p>Flamboyant SoftBank CEO &#8212; <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F10%2F18%2F3521256%2Fsoftbank-buys-sprint-acquisition-news-rumors">and Sprint suitor</a> &#8212; Masayoshi Son strode onto a Tokyo stage this afternoon to unveil his latest scheme to attract Japanese subscribers. SoftBank Healthcare is an unusual contract bolt-on that attempts to leverage the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F11%2F3866204%2Ffitness-health-devices-ces-breakout">rise of personal fitness devices</a> with the carrier's self-professed expertise in cloud and customer services. For &#165;490 ($4.94) a month, you get access to 24-hour healthcare advice over the phone from SoftBank's team of medical specialists, along with the use of an app that tracks your activity data. Most surprisingly, that data will come from a free, subsidized <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F6%2F4303072%2Ffitbit-flex-review">Fitbit Flex</a>, marking the fitness wristband's debut in Japan.</p>

<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="right">SoftBank's app visualizes the effect of an unhealthy lifestyle on your face</q></p>
<p>The deal comes with a few catches. SoftBank says that the regular Fitbit app won't work with the provided band; you'll have to use the carrier's own software, a proprietary app with selling points such as the esoteric Timeline feature, which visualizes the aging effect that a lack of activity will take on your visage. The app will only run on the iPhone 5, 4S, and Sharp's new Aquos Phone Xx 206H, which was also announced today. There's also no word on whether the band will be compatible with Fitbit's own open API for exporting data. And, while SoftBank Healthcare offers a way to pick up a Fitbit Flex without the initial $99 outlay required in the US, the plan can really be thought of as akin to a mobile phone contract &#8212; cancel within two years, and you'll have to pay a &#165;7,500 (about $76) early termination fee.</p>
<p><img alt="Softbank_son1_2040" class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2590053/softbank_son1_2040.jpg" width="560" /><br id="1367914482420" /></p>
<p>Still, SoftBank Healthcare sees the carrier getting ahead of a growing trend in mobile. Samsung has made the most notable splash to date with its <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F14%2F4104072%2Fs-health-turns-the-galaxy-s4-into-a-full-fledged-fitness-tracker">S Health service on the Galaxy S4</a>; the phone's built-in pedometer and other sensors let owners track their steps, diet, and more. Similar features have been offered on Japanese smartphones for several years &#8212; handsets like SoftBank's own <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F5%2F4%2F2968160%2Fsharp-aquos-phone-104sh-review">Aquos Phone 104SH</a> also included a pedometer, for example, although the software hasn't been anywhere near as robust.</p>
<p>The latest breed of fitness devices is yet to really take off in Japan; Nike hasn't released its popular FuelBand in the country, and the Jawbone Up just came out last month. But SoftBank Healthcare could provide a compelling route for Japanese customers to get on board. Son said today that the healthcare service is in keeping with SoftBank's stated goal to "bring happiness to people through an information revolution" &#8212; and after <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F10%2F22%2F3526716%2Fmasayoshi-son-softbank-ceo-profile">driving local adoption of the iPhone</a>, it wouldn't be the first time he's made a Japanese hit out of a product from afar.</p>

<p>Whenever the US Justice Department reviews a merger between two major companies, it often requires careful analysis of millions of electronic documents. In the past, this task has typically fallen upon contract workers, earning between $25 and $40 an hour, but in a recent case involving two beer makers, US authorities decided to replace these employees with a more automated solution: computer software.</p>

Once US authorities and Constellation representatives were convinced of its ability to do so, they allowed it to take over the process.</p>
<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="right">Predictive coding offers significant savings</q></p>
<p>Ultimately, lawyers for Constellation and Crown Imports (a joint venture between Modelo and Constellation) ended up disclosing hundreds of thousands of documents to the Justice Department, which dropped its challenge to the merger after all parties agreed to sell Modelo's US operations to Constellation. They also saved a lot of money. "Something that would easily cost three, four, five million dollars, you can do in the range of one to two," Warren Rosborough, a lawyer who represented Constellation and Crown Imports, told the <em>Journal</em>.</p>
<p>Thus far, however, there aren't any hard regulations on the use of predictive coding across other agencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't bar the practice, though a spokesperson declined to tell the <em>Journal</em> how often it is used. A spokesperson for the Federal Trade Commission said the software is used on a case-by-case basis. The Justice Department says it has used similar software to review internal documents, though it declined to comment on this particular case.</p>
<p>Carl Walworth, a partner at Paul Hastings LLP, expressed skepticism about a computer's ability to completely replace lawyers, noting that a thorough review of documents is often critical to familiarizing oneself with a given case. "More often than not, you're trying to learn your case through the documents," Walworth told the <em>Journal</em>, "and how will we substitute that function of learning from the documents when you're using predictive coding?"</p>

    <div class="itemdescription" id="itemhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/?p=71865">
        <p><strong>Pick one of the following scenes: a torrent is taking an age to complete; a confirmation e-mail is in limbo; or you&#8217;re on hold to a woefully&#160;inept customer services department of a woefully inept company&#160;providing a woefully inept service.</strong></p>
<p>Any sound familiar? They should do. Chances are you have, at some point, been at your desktop or near your laptop and experienced one of the above.</p>
<p>Contrary to our conditioned reflex to tut, sigh and drum fingers as a way to speed up waiting, the quickest way to pass the time is to distract yourself. Some doodle, some sing, some do the washing.</p>
<p>But me, I reach for one of the following <em>University of Procrastination</em>-approved boredom-busting games&#8230;</p>
<h3>Picsaw</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter" src="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/picsaw2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Woof. Woof. Woof.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the noise that my next-door-neighbour&#8217;s dog makes, day-in, day out. It&#8217;s hard to work through it sometimes, particularly if I&#8217;m already having a coffee-wobble.</p>
<p>But the little (and literal) puzzle game <em>Picsaw</em> often comes to the rescue of my clapped-out concentration.&#160;How?</p>
<p>When the barking ramps up (or I&#8217;m stuck on the phone listening to the melodic equivalent of dog food) I simply load up a blurry snap of Fido&#8217;s ill-focused snout (acquired using a combination of string, meaty cat chews, and a zoom lens)&#160;and reassemble him, bit by bit&#8230;</p>
<p>Plus, puzzles are apparently a great workout for your brain &#8211; <em><a href="http://social-psychiatry.com/jigsaw-puzzles-good-brain/" target="_blank">honest!</a></em></p>
<p>For added&#160;difficulty&#160;try using an image with a non-definable pattern to it, like a photo of the sky, animal fur, or spaghetti O&#8217;s!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="ubuntu-software-center-link" href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/picsaw/" target="_self" title=""> Install Picsaw from the Ubuntu Software Center </a></p>
<h3>Tanglet</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter" height="377" src="http://omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/tanglet-new-look.jpg" width="491" /></p>
<p>Tanglet is a single-player version of the popular word-game Boggle.</p>
<p>The goal is simple: try to find as many words as humanly possible by forming connections between adjacent letters shown on the the on-screen board.</p>
<p>Letters can be joined horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction. As long as the letters are next to each other, and the word you&#8217;re spelling is a word is at least 3 letters in length, you&#8217;ll be scoring.</p>
<p>Tanglet has 7 different game modes, each with varying difficulty. It will also keep track of your stats as you play, so you&#8217;ll always be tempted to best yourself.</p>
<p>And nothing is more time-sappingly-worthy than beating yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="ubuntu-software-center-link" href="apt://tanglet" target="_self" title=""> Install Tanglet from the Ubuntu&#160;Software&#160;Center </a></p>
<h3>Gweled</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Gweled game in UBuntu" class="aligncenter" height="376" src="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-14-at-16.52.45-500x376.png" width="500" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No gaming platform is worth its salt if it lacks a jewel-smashing, pattern-linking, time-enveloping game of join-the-bleedin&#8217;-coloured-things-to-score-some-satisfying-points.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#8217;m overdosing on hyperbole in this post, but Gweled does fill a popular gaming niche. A quick glance at the Top games on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Mac App Store, etc all show that jewel games are in hot demand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/05/top-10-ubuntu-apps-for-april" target="_blank" title="Ubuntu&#8217;s Best Selling Apps for April">Though maybe not on Ubuntu, huh? ;)</a></p>
<p>Alongside the traditional gameplay (essentially: &#8216;keep playing until there are no possible moves left&#8217;) there are two extra modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timed Mode &#8211; Achieve the best score in a given time</li>
<li>Endless Mode &#8211; Never-ending game that doesn&#8217;t log your score</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">OMG! Words!</h3>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter" src="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/screen-shot-2012-03-14-at-21.24.03-500x387.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>What did the blanket say to the bed?&#160;I got you covered!</em></p>
<p>Did you laugh? No? Good. That means I can 100% guarantee you&#8217;ll get more fun out of this, the last item on our list: OMG! Words!</p>
<p>Our typing-game-with-a-twist from back yonder is simple to play: type the words on screen as fast &#8211; and correctly &#8211; as you can.&#160;The more words you &#8216;drop&#8217; the soon it&#8217;ll be game is over!</p>
<p>All of the words that appear in the game are pulled from articles on the site.</p>
<p>But things aren&#8217;t overly easy. If you&#8217;re doing too well the visage of OMG! Ubuntu! editor Benjamin Humphrey will slide across the screen and scramble every word it touches.</p>
<p>But i&#8217;m on your side: my face will bandy across and unscramble every word it touches.</p>
<p>Short of a green bird icon dropping in (if you don&#8217;t get that reference, congrats on having avoiding our comment section!), OMG! Words! is a faithful distillation of our irreverence, colour scheme, and typos.</p>
<p>So if you want to combine fun with usefulness then OMG! Words! is a great way to practice your writing prowess.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F26%2F4149516%2Fmicrosoft-announces-build-2013-conference-san-francisco">acknowledging its Windows Blue codename</a> publicly in March, Microsoft is getting closer to revealing all about the upcoming Windows 8 update. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em> this week, Microsoft's Windows CFO Tami Reller provided some details on where the company is heading with its Blue project.</p>
<p>Although <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F2%2F4174664%2Fwindows-8-1-to-be-final-name-for-blue-upgrade">Windows 8.1 has been spotted</a> in a number of leaked builds recently, Reller says Blue is simply an "internal name" and that the company isn't yet discussing exact naming, pricing, and packaging details. All of those details will be revealed by the end of the month she says, well ahead of Microsoft's <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F2%2F4173996%2Fmicrosoft-build-2013-registration-price-date">Build developer conference</a> in June. "Blue is an update," says Reller. "That's a good way to describe it, that's a good way to think about it." It's an update to Windows 8 that Microsoft is focusing on three key areas with: the touch vision, addressing feedback, and new form factors.</p>
<p><q class="left">Microsoft is addressing feedback with Blue</q></p>
<p>One of the biggest areas of Windows 8 criticism is related to its use on a non-touch PC and a lack of a traditional Start button and Start menu. "We do have an opportunity with Blue to address some of the feedback that we're seeing from customers and from the market," says Reller. Although Microsoft isn't listing the exact feedback, Reller admits that the company has heard the cries for a Start button. "We have heard that, we definitely have heard that and taken that into account," she explains. "We've really also tried to understand what people are really asking for when they're asking for that."</p>
<p>Reller stopped short of confirming the Start button will return, but sources close to Microsoft's Windows Blue plans <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F22%2F4251610%2Fwindows-8-1-start-button">have previously revealed</a> the company will include this in the final version. Reller's open approach on Microsoft's plans to act on feedback is a stark contrast to the company's previous efforts under former Windows chief Steven Sinofsky. It appears the company is preparing how to best communicate its upcoming Windows changes in the coming weeks. Reller says Microsoft has also received a lot of feedback from businesses on what they'd like to see in Windows Blue. Microsoft is also believed to be adding an <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F16%2F4229900%2Fwindows-8-1-boot-to-desktop-option">option to boot to desktop</a> in Windows Blue. "I would say we've looked at a broad set of options as we've made decisions on where we take the product going forward, "explains Reller, while not discussing specifics.</p>
<p><q class="right">7- and 8-inch Windows devices will arrive before Blue</q></p>
<p>Although the addressing of feedback is critical, Microsoft's other push with Blue is <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F18%2F4240364%2Fmicrosoft-smaller-touch-devices-tablets-windows">7- and 8-inch form factors</a>. While some of these types of tablets will arrive in the coming months, ahead of Blue, Microsoft <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F29%2F4159884%2Fwindows-8-tablet-specifications-changed">has been working</a> to allow OEMs to bring these devices to market running Windows 8 and Windows RT. "The product as you know it today can run on small screen form factors," says Reller. "We've made sure from the product to our <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F6%2F4069886%2Fwindows-price-cuts-for-new-form-factors-rumor">pricing and offerings</a> we are supporting 7- and 8-inch devices specifically." That said, "Blue does a nice job of optimizing for those small screen form factor sizes," says Reller. "Yes you'll see them before, but Blue also does more to support."</p>
<p>Demand for Windows tablets has been difficult to gauge due to a lack of touch-based hardware and high price points, but Reller believes there's demand for 7- and 8-inch Windows-based devices. "It's still early days in terms of exactly the size within that category, I think we will see some good range even within the small form factor category," she says. "There's definitely interest." Microsoft itself has been rumored to be preparing a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F11%2F4211676%2Fmicrosoft-7-inch-surface-tablet-says-wsj">7-inch version of its Surface tablet,</a> expected later this year. With a focus on these types of devices with Blue, due for the holidays, expect to see a greater emphasis on these tablets in the coming weeks and months as Microsoft moves closer to bringing Blue to market.</p>

<p>Today, nearly all modern smartphones use an ARM-based processor, along with every iPad and practically every Android tablet as well. Soon, though, Intel's x86 silicon might finally pose a challenge. Six years after laying out <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2007%2F05%2F04%2Fintel-touts-20x-less-power-hungry-umpcs-lays-out-processor-road%2F" target="_blank">a roadmap</a> for power-efficient processors for tiny computers, and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2010%2F05%2F05%2Fintel-reaches-for-the-smartphone-zone-with-moorestown-based-at%2F">several</a> failed attempts to make a real dent, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F10%2F4%2F3447984%2Fmotorola-razr-i-review-intel-smartphone" target="_blank">Intel impressed us last October</a> with just how power-efficient its Medfield chip could be compared to the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon. That chip used the company's Saltwell core inside, but this year the company's introducing Silvermont, and Intel claims the new 22nm architecture will more than hold its own against the best ARM has to offer.</p>
<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p>Intel promises three times the performance, or the same performance at five times lower power than the current gen Atom core, a truly serious boost. In charts (see below), Intel showed us how its dual-core processor can theoretically trounce the competition's quad-cores at one watt, and how a quad-core Silvermont-based chip, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F7%2F3847818%2Fintel-bay-trail-atom-quad-core-processor-announced">like the Bay Trail that will appear in tablets and cheap notebooks late this year</a>, should be able to wipe the floor with the competition with just 1.5 watts of power at its disposal. "If you have an efficient solution, you don't need to play the core count game," Intel Fellow Belli Kuttanana told reporters at a press conference.</p>

<div class="gallery inline" id="gallery4071307">
<h3><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F6%2F4307266%2Fintel-silvermont-technical-overview">Intel Silvermont technical&#160;overview</a></h3>

<p>But more CPU power and / or longer battery life is only part of the story. Over a year ago, we heard that the next Atom family would have <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F3%2F23%2F2896674%2Fintel-22nm-valley-view-atom-ivy-bridge-graphics">a drastic improvement in graphics capabilities</a>, switching from an aging, smartphone-class PowerVR SGX 535 or 545 GPU to a few of the same Intel HD GPU cores that the company puts in its latest laptop and desktop processors. At the press conference, a company rep wouldn't go quite that far, but confirmed that both the CPU and GPU in Bay Trail would offer double the performance. That's fantastic news for anyone buying a low-power Windows 8 tablet, which <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F21%2F4004540%2Fintel-vs-microsoft-how-atom-processors-could-kill-windows-rt">performed much better than their ARM-based Windows RT competition</a> but still weren't quite what you'd expect from a full computer. With Silvermont, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.anandtech.com%2Fshow%2F6936%2Fintels-silvermont-architecture-revealed-getting-serious-about-mobile%2F6" target="_blank">processor expert Anand Shimpi says</a> we could possibly see performance out of an Atom computer equal to that of a MacBook Air from 2010.</p>
<p>And if those charts lie, or for whatever reason Intel doesn't manage to rustle up the partners and / or marketing campaign needed to convince OEMs and cellular carriers to build Intel-based tablets and phones, Intel should have an even better chance to wow the market next year, when it goes straight from 22nm Silvermont to a (theoretically) even more power-efficient 14nm with Airmont in 2014. <q class="right">Tick, tick, tick</q> Starting with Silvermont, the company's promising to update its mobile Atom silicon each and every year with a regular cadence, similar to the famous "tick-tock" strategy that won Intel the lion's share of the desktop and laptop market in previous years. Intel finally seems to be dead-serious about mobile, and if it can manage to deliver the goods as planned, the next time you buy <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F16%2F4232380%2Fintel-promises-atom-based-touchscreen-laptops-at-200-dollars">a $200 Android tablet</a>, it might be the highest performing device on the market due to Intel's plans.</p>

        <p class="itembyline">

    <div class="itemdescription" id="itemhttp://www.theverge.com/2013/5/7/4306786/sonys-new-vaio-fit-lineup-entry-level-laptops">
        <div>
<p>Sony's low-end laptops are getting a makeover today: the company has introduced the new Vaio Fit line of entry-level notebooks, though calling them "entry-level" seems to be something of a disservice. The Fit E starts at $549, but it offers Intel's Core processors, discrete Nvidia graphics, hybrid hard drives, and a roomy keyboard and trackpad. In person, the notebook feels much more premium than its price tag, and the $649 Fit (no E) does even better thanks to a handsome aluminum chassis &#8212; the Fit models are thick enough to fit an optical drive, and they're certainly not light enough to be considered ultrabooks, but they're certainly slimmer than most budget laptops. They're available in 14- and 15-inch models, in black, silver, and pink.</p>
<p><q class="center">"We're not going to offer 1366 x 768. We've killed that."</q></p>
<p>"We're really focusing on the power of Sony," Vaio product manager Travis Furst told The Verge. That means collaboration among the company's many parts, that "<a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F4%2F12%2F2943015%2Fsony-strategy-meeting">One Sony</a>" every employee seems to want to talk about. The Fit's most important spec its display, with a nod to Sony's TV division: they come with 1600 x 900 or 1920 x 1080 touchscreens and nothing else. "We're not going to offer 1366 x 768," reps said. "We've killed that."</p>
<p>Sony's other two pillars are audio quality and imaging &#8212; the Fit and Fit E promise huge webcam improvements from the camera team, and much bigger and better sound than you'd expect from a laptop thanks to the company's many audio engineers. In a Kesha-filled demo, the laptop sounded good, though not notably better than any of the other software-enhanced notebook speakers we've seen recently &#8212; regardless, it's nice to see manufacturers caring about audio quality for a change. The Fit is definitely geared toward the back-to-school set, and also offers an iLife-like set of software for photo, video, and audio editing.</p>
<p>Fit will be a catch-all term for this breed of laptop at Sony, as the company tries to simplify its offerings. "We've had E Series, T Series, things like that in the past," Furst said. "Fit kind of combines the best of those, and puts it into one easy-to-understand series." That's why even though Sony's continuing to sell the Vaio T Series 15 a few others, they're an increasingly marginalized part of its offering &#8212; Sony has Duo and Tap, and now it has Fit. As Sony continues to attempt to once again define itself as a maker of premium products, the Fit appears to provide a pretty impressive baseline.</p>

<p>After passing <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F8%2F3852252%2Fmicrosoft-windows-8-60-million-licenses">60 million license sales</a> in early January, Microsoft says it has now sold over 100 million Windows 8 licenses. The company has been rather quiet about its risky product bet recently, choosing to stay silent on numbers during its recent quarter and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F26%2F4265182%2Fwindows-8-sales-after-six-months-are-a-mystery">six month anniversary</a>, but that radio silence has finally ended. The figures are almost identical to Windows 7's early sales performance, with the company originally announcing its <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2010%2F04%2F27%2Fwindows-7-hits-100-million-licenses-mark-becomes-microsofts-fa%2F" target="_blank">100 million goal</a> for that particular OS on April 27th, 2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F10%2F4210382%2Fpc-nose-dive">Recent figures from IDC</a> and Gartner confirm that the traditional PC industry is in decline, and Microsoft's <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F18%2F4239972%2Fmicrosoft-q3-2013-financials-windows-revenue-flat-cfo-peter-klein">flat Windows revenue</a> during Q3 supports that somewhat, but the company is still managing to shift licenses. While the numbers don't paint the whole picture, only showing retail and OEM license sales, the fact they match Windows 7 is encouraging at this early stage. The real question is whether Windows 8 is pushing demand for touch-based Windows machines. These particular devices are still missing on retail shelves, and a number of them are too pricey compared to the non-touch laptop alternatives. They're also the essential selling point for Windows 8.</p>
<p><q class="left">"...we were not happy with the overall level of touch assortment."</q></p>
<p>"As we look back at where we were at the launch of Windows 8 and Windows RT, at that point we were not happy with the overall level of touch assortment," says Microsoft's Windows CFO Tami Teller. Speaking to <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week, Reller says Microsoft has seen "some improvement" in the spring shopping period thanks to Atom-based tablets, but there's still some work to do to get these onto retail shelves. "You'll start to see a much broader range of touch PCs" in the back to school period this year, says Reller thanks to "material progress" on getting these devices to retailers. The real focus appears to be on the holiday season though, with new price points and varied devices running Windows 8 and even the upcoming update: Windows 8.1. "Holiday does really become, we believe, a tipping point for touch," says Reller, while noting that there will still be progress to be made even if devices are where Microsoft wants them to be.</p>
<p><q class="right">Surface sales still a mystery</q></p>
<p>On the topic of Surface sales, Reller says Microsoft is still not talking numbers. Recent figures from IDC suggest that Microsoft <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F1%2F4290498%2Fsurface-shipments-sales-idc-q1-2013">shipped 900,000 Surface tablets</a> in the recent quarter, with Surface Pro making up the majority of sales. "The launch of Pro has also been helpful for Surface overall," says Reller, but the company isn't discussing exactly how popular Pro is compared to RT. Surface RT, which originally debuted on October 26th alongside the Windows 8 release, runs on Microsoft's ARM-based Windows RT operating system. Recently, Windows RT has come under fire from partners as <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F4%2F4299836%2Facer-still-planning-windows-rt-tablets-waiting-windows-8-1">lacking value</a> and "<a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F19%2F4124782%2Fnvidia-ceo-windows-rt-disappointing-microsoft-can-get-it-right%22%3Edisappointing%3C%2Fa%3E%2C"><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F22%2F4134580%2Fmicrosoft-defends-windows-rt-fails-to-answer-criticisms">criticism is mounting</a>.</p>
<p>"Our commitment to the ARM platform is very strong," says Reller. Nvidia and Qualcomm have been "two great partners" for Microsoft she says, so the company remains focused on Windows RT despite the criticism and early days. "We've done, I think, a good job at really listening to our partner feedback on where they want to take the ARM platform," says Reller.

        <div>
<p>In a new report the Pentagon states that it believes the Chinese government was behind some of the hacking attacks in the United States in 2012. As <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424127887323687604578467442670389684.html" target="_blank">reported by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the information comes from a yearly document prepared for Congress <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fassets.sbnation.com%2Fassets%2F2589007%2F2013_China_Report_FINAL.pdf">entitled "Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2013."</a> It states that numerous computer systems in the US &#8212; including those of the US government itself &#8212; were hit with attacks, and that some of them "appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military."</p>
<p>China has been blamed for a series of high-profile hacking attacks that came to light in recent months. Newspapers like <em><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F2%2F2%2F3944528%2Fwashington-post-confirms-attack-by-chinese-hackers%2Fin%2F3709433">The Washington Post</a> ,</em> <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F30%2F3935516%2Fnew-york-times-infiltrated-by-chinese-hackers%2Fin%2F3709433"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>,</em> and the <a class="c2" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F31%2F3938404%2Fwall-street-journal-says-it-was-also-hit-by-chinese-hackers"><em>Journal</em> itself</a> were hit, with some of those attacks reportedly traced back to a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F2%2F18%2F4003732%2Fchinese-cyber-attacks-on-us-corporations-tied-to-army-base">People's Liberation Army base in Shanghai</a>. One of the motives for hacking those newspapers was thought to be the ability to monitor international sentiment of China itself, something which is echoed in the Pentagon's report as well. The document states that China is utilizing cyber-espionage to help collect information that can be used against both the US economic and defense industries, but that the information collected could also be used to help gain a better understanding of what policymakers in the US think of China.</p>
<p>China's Ministry of Defense has <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F2%2F20%2F4007932%2Fchina-denies-cyber-attacks-claims-of-attacks-from-us">steadfastly denied any role in the hacking attacks</a>, and while the US has been <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F22%2F4252432%2Fobama-administration-considering-escalated-response-to-chinese-cyberattacks">looking at more aggressive tactics</a> to deal with future problems they've mostly been couched in the context of dealing with hackers that happen to be <em>within</em> China's borders. However gentle the language may be, the statements made in the new report are much more clear: pinning some of the blame directly on China's government and military.</p>

<p>Bob Woodward, the Washington Post reporter whose work with Carl Epstein on the Watergate scandal played a pivotal role in President Nixon's eventual resignation, isn't the most obvious choice to star as a video game protagonist. But thanks to a burst of inspiration from writer Samuel Kim &#8212; "Hey, there ought to be a sequel to <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FShadowgate" target="_blank"><em>Shadowgate</em></a> called <em>Watergate</em>!" &#8212; that's exactly what's happened.</p>
<p><em>Watergate: The Video Game</em> plays like a classic point-and-click adventure at first, with Woodward assigned to cover the infamous break-in at the DNC headquarters &#8212; but, as <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fmotherboard.vice.com%2Fblog%2Fwatergate-the-video-game-exists-and-its-awesome" target="_blank">Kim tells <em>Motherboard</em></a>, this makes for a "soul-crushingly boring video game." What could not be described as soul-crushingly boring, however, is the surreal turn that <em>Watergate</em> quickly takes, involving an acid trip represented by a <em>Mega Man</em> shooting game, an graphic fight to the death with White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, and a <em>Punch-Out!!</em>-style punch-out with Nixon himself.</p>
<p><em>Watergate</em> should appeal to alternate historians and video game archivists alike: it features many other references to other Nintendo games, including audio cues lifted straight from the likes of <em>Zelda</em> and a cameo appearance from a certain pair of plumbing brothers. You can play it for yourself <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwatergategame.com%2F" target="_blank">at this link</a>.</p>

  <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/44/"><h1>High Throw</h1></a>
  <p id="question">How high can a human throw something?</p>

<p id="attribute">&#8212;Irish Dave on the Isle of Man</p>

<p>Humans are good at throwing things. In fact, we&#8217;re great at it; no other animal can throw stuff like we can. </p>

<p>It's true that chimpanzees hurl feces (and, on rare occasions, stones), but they&#8217;re not nearly as accurate or precise as humans.<sup>[<a href="http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/2009/10/prehistory-of-throwing-things.html">1</a>][<a href="http://www.academia.edu/235788/Chapter_9._Stone_tools_and_the_evolution_of_hominin_and_human_cognition">2</a>]</sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antlion">Antlions</a>&#160;throw sand, but they don&#8217;t aim it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archerfish">Archerfish</a>&#160;hunt insects by throwing water droplets, but they use specialized mouths instead of arms. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_lizard">Horned lizards</a>&#160;shoot jets of blood from their eyes for distances of up to five feet. I don&#8217;t know <em>why</em> they do this, because whenever I reach the phrase &#8220;shoot jets of blood from their eyes&#8221; in an article I just stop there and stare at it until I need to lie down.</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_blood.png" title="AAAAAAAAAAAAAA" />

<p>So while there are other animals that use projectiles, we&#8217;re just about the only animal that can grab a random object and reliably nail a target. In fact, we&#8217;re so good at it that some researchers have suggested rock-throwing played a central role in the evolution of the modern human brain.<sup>[<a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com/1990s/1993Unitary.htm">3</a>][<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1571064/">4</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Throwing is hard. In order to deliver a baseball to a batter, a pitcher has to release the ball at exactly the right point in the throw. A timing error of half a&#160;millisecond in either direction is enough to cause the ball to miss the strike zone.<sup>[<a href="http://jn.physiology.org/content/75/3/1013.full.pdf">5</a>]</sup></p>

<p>To put that in perspective, it takes about <em>five</em>&#160;milliseconds for the fastest nerve impulse to travel the length of the arm.<sup>[<a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/DavidParizh.shtml">6</a>]</sup> That means that when your arm is still rotating toward the correct position, the signal to release the ball is already at your wrist. In terms of timing, this is like a drummer dropping a drumstick from the 10th story and hitting a drum on the ground <em>on the correct beat</em>.</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_drumstick.png" title="wrong kind of drumstick but hey, i like the sound." />

<p>We seem to be much better at throwing things forward than throwing them upward.&#160;Since we&#8217;re going for maximum height, we could use projectiles that curve upward when you throw them forward; the <a href="http://aerobie.com/products/orbiter.htm">Aerobie Orbiters</a>&#160;I had when I was a kid often got stuck in the highest treetops. But we could also sidestep the whole problem by using a device like this one:</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_redirector.png" title="a mechanism for hitting yourself in the head with a baseball after a four-second delay" />

<p>It could be a springboard, a greased chute, or even a dangling sling&#8212;anything that redirects the object upward without adding to&#8212;or subtracting from&#8212;its speed. Of course, we could also try this:</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_gravity.png" title="i just came in to get a glass of water let me down" />

<p>But the deflector box seems easier.</p>

<p>I ran through the basic aerodynamic calculations for a baseball thrown at various speeds. I will give these in units of giraffes:</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_giraffe.png" title="recommended SI unit for altitude" />

<p>The average person can probably throw a baseball at least three giraffes high:</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_3.png" title="top-tier giraffes" />

<p>Someone with a reasonably good arm could manage five:</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_5.png" title="order your giraffe stacks now" />

<p>A pitcher with an 80 mph fastball could manage ten giraffes:</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_10.png" title="act now while supplies are still cooperative" />

<p>Aroldis Chapman, the holder of the world record for fastest recorded pitch (105 mph), could in theory launch a baseball 14 giraffes high:</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_14.png" title="act now while supplies are still cooperative" />

<p>But what about projectiles other than a baseball? Obviously, with the aid of tools like slings, crossbows, or the curved <em>xistera</em>&#160;scoops in jai alai, we can launch projectiles much faster than that. But for this question, let&#8217;s assume we stick to bare-handed throwing.</p>

<p>A baseball is probably not the ideal projectile, but it&#8217;s hard to find speed data on other kinds of thrown objects. Fortunately, a British javelin thrower named Roald Bradstock held a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78OPnVweKeg">random object throwing competition</a>, in which he threw everything from dead fish to an actual kitchen sink. Bradstock&#8217;s experience gives us a lot of useful data (and a lot of other data, too). In particular, it suggests a potentially superior projectile: A golf ball.</p>

<p>Few professional athletes have been recorded throwing golf balls. Fortunately, Bradstock has, and he claims&#160;a record throw (to first contact with the ground) of 170 yards.<sup>[<a href="http://recordsetter.com/world-record/world-record-for-throwing-golf-ball/7349#contentsection">7</a>]</sup> This involved a running start, but even so, it&#8217;s reason to think that a golf ball might work better than a baseball. It makes sense; the limiting factor in baseball pitches is the torque on the elbow, and the lighter golf ball might allow the pitching arm to move slightly faster.</p>

<p>The speed improvement from using a golf ball instead of a baseball would probably not be very large, but it seems plausible that a professional pitcher with some time to practice could throw a golf ball faster than a baseball.</p>

<p>If so, based on aerodynamic calculations, Aroldis Chapman could probably throw a golf ball about sixteen giraffes high:</p>

<img class="illustration" src="http://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/44/high_throw_16.png" title="two more giraffes high and you&#8217;ve got a team" />

<p>This is probably about the maximum possible altitude for a thrown object.</p>

<p>&#8230; unless you count the technique by which any five-year-old can beat all these records easily:</p>

        <p>LibreOffice certainly doesn't follow the <a href="http://elementaryos.org/docs/human-interface-guidelines">elementary HIG</a>, but there are a few tweaks to make it more elementary-like. This article describes a method to minimize the menu bar, create a hot key to toggle the menu, and create a menu toggle icon.

<h4>Create the Macro</h4>
In LibreWriter, go to  Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > LibreOffice Basic. Navigate to Module1 and create a new Macro.
<center><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Vsfio7vOlrk/UYaxdQgyWmI/AAAAAAAABpM/lBkr7YIT7-w/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+12:21:56.png"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Vsfio7vOlrk/UYaxdQgyWmI/AAAAAAAABpM/lBkr7YIT7-w/s320/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+12:21:56.png" /></a></center>
In the LibreOffice editor, paste the following code.

<code>
Sub HideMenuBar<br />
layout = Thiscomponent.CurrentController.Frame.LayoutManager<br />
layout.hideElement("private:resource/menubar/menubar")<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Sub ShowMenuBar<br />
layout = Thiscomponent.CurrentController.Frame.LayoutManager<br />
layout.showElement("private:resource/menubar/menubar")<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Sub MenuToggle<br />
Dim sUrl as String : sUrl = "private:resource/menubar/menubar"<br />
If NOT ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame.LayoutManager.IsElementVisible( sUrl ) Then<br />
ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame.LayoutManager.showElement( sUrl )<br />
Else<br />
ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame.LayoutManager.hideElement( sUrl )<br />
EndIf<br />
End Sub
</code>

Congratulations. You've completed the code portion. Let's integrate it and make it functional.<br />
<br />
<h4>Create a HotKey Toggle</h4>
We are going to map our new MenuToggle to a hotkey. In our case, we think CONTROL+M seems intuitive, but you may chose any key option that makes sense for you. <br /><br />

From the menu, navigate to Tools > Customize > Keyboard. In the top "Shortcut keys" pane, select the hotkey that you wish. In the bottom-left "Category" pane, select LibreOffice Macros > user > Standard > module1. In the "Function" pane, choose MenuToggle. Select Modify and you're done.<br /><br />
<center><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YzQmlw3HCWU/UYa2Et78ItI/AAAAAAAABpY/CPgHHihYg0w/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+12:31:15.png"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YzQmlw3HCWU/UYa2Et78ItI/AAAAAAAABpY/CPgHHihYg0w/s320/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+12:31:15.png" /></a></center>
Test that it works. You should now be able to show and hide the menu by using the new hotkey.<br /><br />

<h4>Create a Menu Button</h4>
From the menu, navigate to Tools > Customize > Toolbars. Create a new toolbar. I named my toolbar "Menu". Add a new item, and select it by: LibreOffice Macros > user > Standard > module1. Select MenuToggle and add it.<br /><br />
<center><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aD0IWbS-qHo/UYa8PZm-UYI/AAAAAAAABpk/aMNbMCykUP8/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+13:07:54.png"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aD0IWbS-qHo/UYa8PZm-UYI/AAAAAAAABpk/aMNbMCykUP8/s320/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+13:07:54.png" /></a></center>
You may change the icon by selecting "Change Icon" under the "Modify" button.
<center><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5sHsPXIW3I4/UYa9He5hk_I/AAAAAAAABpw/rcTKLXcVCwA/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+13:10:00.png"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5sHsPXIW3I4/UYa9He5hk_I/AAAAAAAABpw/rcTKLXcVCwA/s320/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+13:10:00.png" /></a></center>
Position your new toolbar to the far right.

<h4>Launch LibreOffice without a Menu</h4>
Again, navigate to Tools > Customize > Events. Add your new macro to the following events:
<ul>
<li>New Document</li>
<li>View Created</li>
<li>Activate Document</li>
</ul>
Be sure to save it in LibreOffice in the bottom dropdown menu.
<center><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UVE39TSPgjE/UYa-buw_cOI/AAAAAAAABqE/MUB8sBx5Rp0/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+13:16:22.png"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UVE39TSPgjE/UYa-buw_cOI/AAAAAAAABqE/MUB8sBx5Rp0/s320/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+13:16:22.png" /></a></center><br />
<h4>Special Note About Faenza Icons</h4>
If you are using the modern <a href="http://www.elementaryupdate.com/2013/04/libreoffice-on-elementary-part-1.html">Faenza icon theme</a>, you must change the icon view to small. Go to Tools > Options > View .

<center><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uNrmTyBr-70/UYa_Nz99Q8I/AAAAAAAABqM/80WLlovswwU/s1600/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+13:20:54.png"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uNrmTyBr-70/UYa_Nz99Q8I/AAAAAAAABqM/80WLlovswwU/s320/Screenshot+from+2013-05-05+13:20:54.png" /></a></center><br />

<h4>Final View</h4>

Here's the finished product.

<p>It's not quite a quantum internet &#8212; yet. But researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico have developed a new, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1305.0305" target="_blank">ultra-secure computer network</a> that is capable of transmitting data that has been encrypted by quantum physics, including video files. The network, which currently consists of a main server and three client machines, has been running continuously in Los Alamos for the past <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lanl.gov%2Forgs%2Ftt%2Fpdf%2Ftechs%2Fquantum_crypt.pdf" target="_blank">two and a half years</a>, the researchers reported in a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1305.0305" target="_blank">paper released earlier this month</a>. During that time, they have also successfully tested sending critical information used by power companies on the status of the electrical grid. Eventually they hope to use it to test offline quantum communication capabilities on smartphones and tablets.</p>

<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="right">"prevent a hacking attack on the electrical grid."</q></p>
<p>"There's a need for secure communications to prevent a hacking attack on the electrical grid," said Richard Hughes, a fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory who is involved in the experiment. "At the same time, there are very demanding requirements for low latency. You can't have the normal time delays introduced by traditional cryptography." But Los Alamos researchers were able to satisfy but the grid's low latency requirement &#8212; that is, the need for ultrafast, near real-time communications, as well as improve security, by developing a new type of quantum network. Previously, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F2%2F4175598%2Fquantum-encrypted-information-transmitted-by-flying-plane-for-first">other types of quantum test networks</a> have required that secure connections, or "trust," be established between every single machine on the network for every type of communication sent, slowing down the rate of transmission.</p>
<p>But in the Los Alamos quantum communications network, the central server acts the primary trusted authority, and handles all of the cryptographic key management functions, everything from quantum key distribution (that means sending two machines the keys necessary to establish a secure communications channel between them), to electronic signatures and certificates, which allow the communications to be sent and received.</p>
<p>The entire field of <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fbook.itep.ru%2Fdepository%2Fquant_crypt%2Fdave-thorne.pdf" target="_blank">quantum cryptography</a>, first proposed in the 1970s, relies on transmitting data in short bursts of light, using quantum physics to encode it, creating a communications channel so secure that the participants will know instantly if it has been cracked. "We've sent encrypted video with a key that rolls over every second, so even if someone broke an encryption key, it's only valid for a few seconds." Hughes told <em>The Verge</em>. The system relies on specialized equipment right now, including <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lanl.gov%2Fscience-innovation%2Fscience-features%2Fquantum-cryptography-handhelds.php" target="_blank">smart cards developed at Los Alamos</a> over the past 18 years, and a custom server, but Hughes said researchers were hopeful that they could integrate the technology into consumer devices in the near future.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F22%2F4252994%2Fphotos-8-inch-acer-tablet-windows-8-new-screen-sizes">months of rumors</a> that smaller, cheaper Windows 8 tablets are on the way, Asus will reportedly release such a tablet later this year. Jerry Shen, Asus' CEO, also told the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle_email%2FSB10001424127887324326504578466122367669576-lMyQjAxMTAzMDAwNjEwNDYyWj.html"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> that he believes prices for Windows 8 tablets will drop to an average of $300 before the year's end. Currently, most Windows 8 tablets are priced around $400 to $500, with displays of about 10-inches, so a cheaper option would give Windows a chance to compete more directly with the likes of Apple's iPad Mini and Google's Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Microsoft knows all this, and knows that it needs to get into the mini tablet game. So far, Asus appears to only be joined by Acer with plans to create a smaller Windows 8 tablet. On Friday, we saw an <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F3%2F4297490%2Facer-w3-810-8-inch-windows-8-tablet-specs-price">an 8.1-inch Acer tablet appear briefly on Amazon</a>. Microsoft is also <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F11%2F4211676%2Fmicrosoft-7-inch-surface-tablet-says-wsj">rumored to be building a 7-inch Surface</a> tablet that could launch later this year.</p>
<p><q class="center">Does anybody want a small Windows 8 tablet?</q></p>
<p>One matter that is still unclear at this point is what version of Windows 8 Asus' mini slates will run. Choosing between Microsoft's two versions of Window 8 has been a contentious issue. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F4%2F4299836%2Facer-still-planning-windows-rt-tablets-waiting-windows-8-1">Acer President Jim Wong said there's "no value" in Windows RT</a>, although that company has said it was <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F8%2F17%2F3248115%2Facer-committed-to-developing-windows-rt-hardware">committed to making Windows RT products</a>. And there's still the open question as to whether or not anybody wants to buy a smaller Windows 8 tablet.

<p>Making a movie in Hollywood is no cheap venture &#8212; that's why for a mere $20,000 or so extra, many productions are hiring script analysis firms to turn their films into algorithmic hits. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F05%2F06%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fsolving-equation-of-a-hit-film-script-with-data.html" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em> spoke with one script analyst</a>, who explained what elements show up in films that flop at the box office (bowling alleys) and what tweaks can make a film shine when it hits theaters (demons should choose to haunt, rather than arise from a summoning). Naturally, many screenwriters aren't thrilled with being asked to conform to monetarily sound ideas, but for better or (almost certainly) worse, the process may actually be working: <em>Oz the Great and Powerful</em> underwent review early in production, and it's made over $480 million to date.</p>

<p><small>An array of Aereo's coin-sized antennas, designed to pick up TV signals and retransmit them to paying subscribers.</small></p>
<p>The bluster-fueled battle between upstart Aereo and incombent over-the-air broadcasters has reached a fever pitch in recent days, most recently with a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F6%2F4304904%2Faereo-files-suit-against-cbs-to-head-off-second-copyright-claim-from">legal complaint designed to prevent CBS from filing another copyright lawsuit against the service</a> as it prepares to launch in Boston later this month.</p>
<p>There's no love lost, and little hope for a truce. Legacy broadcasters fundamentally believe that Aereo is outright stealing their content, which it retransmits over the internet to paying subscribers. The legal system has <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F1%2F4170312%2Faereo-wins-major-court-battle-against-tv-networks%2Fin%2F2779059">thus far disagreed</a>, leading executives at both Fox and CBS to posit a nearly unthinkable "nuclear option": pulling their networks off the airwaves altogether and moving to a cable-only model, just like TBS, CNN, or AMC.</p>

<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="center">A crazy &#8212; but extraordinarily lucrative &#8212; idea</q></p>
<p>It's easy to dismiss the notion of America's over-the-air stalwarts going dark &#8212; it seems unthinkable. For decades, Americans have been able to buy any television, plug in a set of rabbit ears (more recently, digital rabbit ears), and get the basics: ABC, NBC, CBS. More recently, Fox and CW joined the fold. It practically seems like a basic right.</p>
<p>But it's not. "If we go to cable, if we are forced to, then about 10 percent of America will not get our signal and I don't think they will like that," CBS chief Leslie Moonves <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F30%2F4287878%2Fcbs-ceo-moonves-says-he-could-take-network-cable-only-in-a-few-days">said at a recent panel</a>. And for Moonves, it could be a win-win: what if CBS and its fellow broadcasters are financially incentivized to the tune of billions of dollars in exchange for going off the air?</p>
<p>It's not as far fetched as it sounds. The FCC's so-called incentive auctions, which have been in development for several years, are designed to give television broadcasters a voluntary, opt-in opportunity to sell the lucrative RF spectrum that they own. The idea is simple: having run out of easy ways to keep up with exponential growth in the demand for high-speed wireless data &#8212; e.g., your LTE smartphone &#8212; the FCC is turning to television stations to pony up any airwaves they're not using or could live without in exchange for cash.</p>
<p>Considering how hard high-quality spectrum is to come by, these auctions could generate billions upon billions of dollars for TV stations, possibly <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiercewireless.com%2Fspecial-reports%2F600-mhz-broadcast-tv-spectrum-spectrum-auction-guide" target="_blank">$20 billion or more</a> by some estimates.</p>
<p><q class="right">It's not as far-fetched as it sounds</q></p>
<p>The traditional logic is that major broadcasters in major markets carrying big-name networks consumed by millions of households wouldn't relinquish their spectrum, no matter the price. Instead, unused or underused licenses would be the first to sell, after which the FCC would "repack" the remaining stations to make room for a nice, fat, contiguous block of airwaves for LTE and other broadband technologies that wireless carriers can use. But the Aereo situation could be a game-changer: suddenly, the white-hot bluster coming out of the mouths of CBS and Fox executives is backed by a $20 to $30 billion payday.</p>
<p>Conveniently, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fcbscorporation.com%2Fportfolio.php%3Fdivision%3D96" target="_blank">CBS directly owns 29 stations</a>, most in major markets, while Fox parent <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newscorp.com%2Foperations%2Ftvstations.html" target="_blank">News Corporation owns 27</a>. Every station sits on a lucrative license to regional spectrum that it uses to broadcast its signal. By submitting those licenses to the FCC's auction, these networks would stand to see a windfall, shutting the door on Aereo (which relies on over-the-air signals to collect its source content) in the process. Meanwhile, American households that rely entirely on over-the-air television &#8212; <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nab.org%2Fdocuments%2Fnewsroom%2FpressRelease.asp%3Fid%3D2761" target="_blank">a recent GfK report estimates them at 17.8 percent of the viewing public</a> &#8212; would be the pawns in the game.</p>
<p>Rules for the incentive auctions aren't even set to be ratified until later this year with an actual auction not likely until 2014, so broadcasters still have plenty of time to stew on the concept. But for Aereo and consumers, the promise of a multi-billion-dollar payout to any network bold enough to turn off the switch should certainly be cause for alarm.</p>

        <p>As I have said (probably) dozens of times before, there is a frustration in mentioning console chat clients here.</p>
<p>To wit, if I don&#8217;t have an account with the chat <em>service</em>, there&#8217;s little point in showing the chat <em>client</em>. Usually I can&#8217;t even sign on.</p>
<p>This time I went the extra mile for you and opened an account, just to show <a href="http://dev.ojnk.net/" target="_blank">pork</a> in action.</p>
<p><a href="http://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2013-04-04-solo-2150-pork.png"><img alt="2013-04-04-solo-2150-pork" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1301" height="112" src="http://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2013-04-04-solo-2150-pork.png?w=150&#038;h=112" width="150" /></a></p>
<p>Ironic though, that there&#8217;s nothing to show for action, since I don&#8217;t know anyone who uses AOL&#8217;s instant message service. <img alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" /> </p>
<p>No matter, you get the idea. pork is quick to set up and uses slash-prefixed commands to do most of the dirty work. </p>
<p>It has a long list of in-game help pages (as you can see) to get you started. </p>
<p>And it uses a lot of colors, so I am quite pleased with it. How did I ever become so shallow &#8230; ? <img alt=":|" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" /> </p>

Congratulations and thank you to all involved; the Debian developers, hackers, testers, document writers, designers, bug reporters and users -- you are all awesome.</p><p>Now that Wheezy has migrated to the stable branch of Debian, this means that Waldorf is the new stable #! release. To acknowledge this occasion, I have rebuilt the Waldorf images. The new images are available now from the <a href="http://crunchbang.org/download/">download page</a>.</p><p>For anyone unaware, #! Waldorf has been in development for well over a year and has seen numerous development releases (<a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=213329#p213329">20120430</a>, <a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=249348#p249348">20120806</a>, <a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=260069#p260069">20120924</a>, <a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=260816#p260816">20120927</a>, <a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=264474#p264474">20121015</a>, <a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=284488#p284488">20130119</a>). This probably makes Waldorf the most thoroughly tested #! release to date and as a result, I believe it is also the best #! release, ever, truly.</p><p>A massive thank you goes out to everybody who has helped with Waldorf, it really would not have been possible without your continued feedback, bug reports, contributions and support.</p><p>Note; for anyone who is already running Waldorf, there is no need to download and install these images.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after I was supposed to be at Google HQ, learning how to wear the company's <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F2%2F22%2F4013406%2Fi-used-google-glass-its-the-future-with-monthly-updates">hotly anticipated Glass headset</a>, I found myself stuck in stop-and-go traffic not a mile from the Mountain View campus. Worried that I might miss my only chance to try the tech, I frantically looked through my phone for a number I could call to push back my 9AM appointment, or a way to get around the cars blocking my path. I don't use my phone while actually driving, and even this use, stopped in traffic, set me on edge. "If only I already had Google Glass," I thought, "I could have done this much easier."</p>
<p>More on that in a bit.</p>
<p>When I got to my new 9:30AM appointment, a friendly bearded gentleman named Nathaniel (or was it Andrew? or Alexander?) greeted me inside the newly-designated Glass building on Google's campus. He began grooming me for an extensive one-hour fitting session where, I understood, he'd introduce me to every tiny facet of the hardware and generally make me feel like a citizen of a new era. I didn't have the time to spare, though &#8212; I had a 10:25 interview with aerospace magnate Sir Richard Branson at the San Jose Airport. I was in a rush. So instead of a long introduction, I decided to test just how easy it is to become a Google cyborg.</p>
<p><img alt="20130506-12135657--20130501_095032_623_verge_super_wide-875" class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2587509/20130506-12135657--20130501_095032_623_verge_super_wide-875.jpg" /><br id="1367869179270" /></p>
<p>Physically, it's not very hard. You press the power button on the back of the earpiece. You put the glasses on your head. If it's your first time, you then take them off again to adjust the two nosepieces. Then, you rest it on your nose such that the eyepiece is up above your right eye &#8212; you won't actually be looking at it unless you glance upwards or tilt your neck down, but that seems to be intentional. Finally, you swivel the eyepiece until you can clearly see a glowing box inside that little glass cube. It only took me about three minutes to adjust the first time, and it fit fairly well from then on. You can also optionally add a special pair of sunglasses to Glass, which snaps into the nosebridge.</p>
<p><q class="left">Getting fitted is quick &#8212; setting up takes a bit longer</q></p>
<p>Then, you tap your right temple, say "OK Glass," and issue a voice command. Easy, no? Only the present version of Glass doesn't actually do anything of value unless you connect it to Wi-Fi. If I wanted to use it in the car on the way to meet Sir Richard Branson &#8212; and, I hoped, to impress him with the hottest new gadget in town &#8212; I'd have to turn my smartphone into a battery-draining portable Wi-Fi hotspot, and pair it over Bluetooth as well. That took quite a few more presses, and a good bit of setup on the phone. You can't connect Glass to Wi-Fi, for instance, without using the MyGlass app or a tethered computer, and if you want to call or text anyone you'll have to specifically add a contact from Gmail to Glass on a separate computer before you make a call.</p>
<p><img alt="2013-04-30_21-38-27verge_verge_super_wide" class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2587605/2013-04-30_21-38-27verge_verge_super_wide.jpg" /></p>
<p>Eventually I was connected, and I spent a few minutes swiping and tapping my way through the touchpad interface. Everything you see in Glass appears as a "card" in a virtual carousel. Starting from the "OK Glass" screen, swiping backwards will only lead you to the settings page, but swiping forwards takes you to every previous interaction you&#8217;ve had with Glass, including searches you&#8217;ve made, photographs you&#8217;ve taken, messages you&#8217;ve sent and received, and trips you&#8217;ve plotted. Tapping selects one for limited interaction (tapping a photo only allows you to delete or share), and you can cancel actions or turn off the display by swiping down. There&#8217;s also a fairly sizable physical button on the corner of the frames that will instantly snap a photo.</p>
<p>After taking a few photos and trying a few quick searches I realized that 20 minutes had passed. Feeling like Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise, I told Glass to lay in a course for San Jose Airport, cursed myself for forgetting to turn on GPS on my phone, rectified that quickly (again, having to reach for my phone), and took the helm of my aging automobile. Then it was time for a true test of Glass's capabilities on the freeway.</p>

<p>Verizon LTE is plentiful in San Jose, particularly on highways, and I didn't lose connection on the way. I did, however, come to the realization that Glass isn't yet remotely close to the driver-safe, hands-free computing panacea I'd been dreaming of for years. Taking pictures and 10-second video clips of exactly what I saw on the road is pretty awesome, but feels surprisingly dangerous... you have to look directly at what you&#8217;re photographing, so you won&#8217;t be getting any safe photographs unless they&#8217;re <em>of</em> the road. More importantly, Glass's ability to look up important information on the go is extremely thin right now. Googling "Sir Richard Branson" brought up only the barest "oh, that guy" blurb, and other web searches were similarly limited to identifying websites rather than actually reading their content. And that's just the first of many limitations I discovered.</p>
<p><q class="right">I couldn't see or hear enough for Glass to work in the car</q></p>
<p>While I loved having turn-by-turn directions from Google Maps navigation floating in my peripheral vision, the display wasn't bright enough for me to see those directions while looking out the windshield of my car. I had to glance up towards the car's ceiling, or place a hand behind the cube to see where I was going. When I realized that I should call Sir Richard's PR agent, it was too late to link her number to Glass, and I wasn't about to whip out my phone at 65 miles per hour. When another person called, I was able to pick up easily enough by tapping Glass at my temple, but the bone-conducting speaker wasn't loud enough to hear over the noise of the car. I had to enunciate extremely clearly and loudly for Glass to interpret my voice searches correctly. And by the time I reached San Jose Airport, less than an hour after I arrived at Google that morning, I'd already used up a full third of the headset's battery life.</p>
<p>The other thing I missed on the way to the airport was an email from Sir Richard Branson's agent about a change of plan. He decided to fly out early... roughly about a minute before I got there. "If only I'd hooked up Glass to my personal email account before I left," I thought, "at least I wouldn't have needed to rush."</p>
<p><img alt="20130506-12135657--20130501_100523_514_verge_super_wide-875" class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2587533/20130506-12135657--20130501_100523_514_verge_super_wide-875.jpg" /><br id="1367869234504" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: when I&#8217;m in the driver&#8217;s seat, Google Glass is exactly the kind of tool I want. I&#8217;m looking for a hands-free device that can show and tell me things that I need to know and guide me on my way, before I reach my destination.</p>
<p>What the $1,500 Explorer Edition currently provides, though, is far too little information that relies far too heavily on my phone for even the little it does have to offer. With an integrated cell modem and more thought into how to make things I need accessible on that tiny screen, there&#8217;s loads of potential.</p>

<p>After HP purchased Palm, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F6%2F5%2F3062611%2Fpalm-webos-hp-inside-story-pre-postmortem">gutted it</a>, and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F2%2F25%2F4027018%2Flg-buys-webos-smart-tv">sold its remains to LG</a>, Palm's former CEO Jon Rubinstein has kept a relatively low profile. Rubinstein may not yet be ready to make a big splash, but he is set to join Qualcomm's board of directors, reports <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fallthingsd.com%2F20130506%2Fexclusive-jon-rubinstein-joins-board-of-qualcomm-as-mobile-chipmaker-ups-its-silicon-valley-cred%2F%3Fmod%3Datdtweet" target="_blank"><em>All Things D</em></a>. Rubinstein already <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fphx.corporate-ir.net%2Fphoenix.zhtml%3Fc%3D97664%26amp%3Bp%3Dirol-govmanage" target="_blank">serves on Amazon's board</a>, and on Qualcomm he would be adding his years of experience building products to Qualcomm's expertise in creating the chips that power them. Qualcomm quickly <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fstory%2Fqualcomm-elects-jonathan-rubinstein-to-board-of-directors-2013-05-06" target="_blank">confirmed the report in a press release</a>, wherein Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs said that "His experience in creating revolutionary consumer electronics and mobile products will provide added insight to Qualcomm's board."</p>
<p>Beyond helping create the original iPod, Rubinstein is best known for helming Palm as it tried to reinvent itself with webOS and the Pre series of phones. The company essentially ran out of runway and was purchased by HP, who failed utterly to put sufficient resources behind webOS and then killed its chances as then-CEO Leo Apotheker tried to reinvent HP as a services company. Rubinstein <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2011%2F07%2F11%2Fhp-shakeup-webos-led-stephen-dewitt-jon-rubinstein-charge-product-innovation%2F">stepped back to a generic "product innovation" role at HP in July of 2011</a> only to <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F1%2F27%2F2752496%2Fjon-rubinstein-former-palm-ceo-leaves-hp">leave enitrely in January 2012</a>.</p>
<p>Joining Qualcomm makes sense for both Rubinstein and the company. When <em>The Verge</em> <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F1%2F27%2F2752581%2Fjon-rubinstein-going-to-take-some-well-deserved-time-off">spoke to Rubinstein in January of 2012</a>, he said that after a "break" he would continue in that space: "I think the future is mobile."</p>

<p>Posting a fake story on a reputable news source's Twitter feed can lead to <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F1%2F4290108%2Fhacked-ap-twitter-account-shows-need-for-new-high-speed-trading-rules">momentary public panic</a>, but what happens when you post real grievances to a fake news feed? Earlier today, readers of satirical news source <em>The Onion</em> began <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2013%2F05%2F06%2Fonion-syrian-electronic-army_n_3223367.html%3Futm_hp_ref%3Dtw" target="_blank">seeing strange tweets and Facebook messages</a> on various social media accounts. "UN's Ban Ki Moon condemns Syria for being struck by israel: 'It was in the way of Jewish missiles,'" read one. "BREAKING: #TheOnion readership mass confusion as Syrian Electronic Army takes over. All demand a permanent column," said another. Most included links with the shortened <em>Onion</em> format, but none led to real articles.</p>
<p>Hacks are usually easy to identify, but as the tweets unfolded over the course of an hour, it was hard to tell whether this was an actual Syrian Electronic Army attack or a meta-joke by <em>The Onion</em> itself. High-profile Twitter hacks have become commonplace enough that they've entered the site's cultural landscape, as have endless guessing games about whether a given tweet is real or the work of hackers. Back in February, the managers of MTV and BET's Twitter feeds <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F2%2F19%2F4006718%2Fafter-mtv-and-bets-fake-hacking-the-jokes-on-twitter">pretended to hack each other's accounts</a>, briefly changing them to "Hacked MTV" and "BET Hacked" before coming clean. In this light, it's easy to read <em>The Onion's</em> tweets as a strange meta-exercise: a site known for satirical news pretends to be a group of fairly serious hacktivists by posting less-funny versions of its usual fake tweets.</p>
<p>In the end, that doesn't seem to have been the case. While neither <em>The Onion</em> nor Twitter responded to requests for comment, the offending tweets were soon removed, suggesting a real hack. Not long after, <em>The Onion</em> posted its own take on the situation:</p>
<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" />
<p>Soon after, another article went up, this one titled "<a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theonion.com%2Farticles%2Fsyrian-electronic-army-has-a-little-fun-before-ine%2C32324%2F%3Futm_source%3DTwitter%26amp%3Butm_medium%3DSocialMarketing%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dstandard-post%3Aheadline%3Adefault" target="_blank">Syrian Electronic Army Has A Little Fun Before Inevitable Upcoming Deaths At Hands Of Rebels</a>." Both pieces credit the Syrian Electronic Army with hacking <em>The Onion's</em> Twitter feed, then proceed to detail password changes or the hackers' impending deaths. "We figured that before they bust in here and execute every single one of us, we might as well have a good time and post some silly tweets about Israel from a major media outlet's feed," <em>The Onion</em> quotes a "spokesperson" from the SEA as saying. A <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fstorify.com%2FLadySnarksalot%2Fwhat-happens-when-theonion-gets-hacked" target="_blank">full Storify of the tweets can be found here</a> &#8212; assuming, of course, that neither <em>The Onion</em> nor the SEA have some final act in the works.</p>

<p>The future of <em>Star Wars</em> video games was uncertain following Disney's decision to shutter LucasArts, but now the company has announced that it has signed an exclusive, multi-year deal with Electronic Arts to develop games based off the franchise. Game developers DICE, Visceral, and Bioware will work on titles that are based in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe (the latter has already published games like <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>). EA's Frank Gibeaua said in a press release that the games will be "entirely original with all new stories and gameplay," though they "may borrow from films." The deal doesn't give EA complete control over all Star Wars video game titles, however: Disney will hold onto the right to develop and publish titles in the "mobile, social, tablet and online game categories." It's not clear if EA will pick up on any of the work that LucasArts was doing before it was shut down last month, including <em>Star Wars 1313</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Spotify has released an updated version of their desktop app for Linux.&#160;</strong></p>
<p>Unlike the<a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/spotify-update-brings-linux-users-new-features-first" target="_blank" title="Spotify Update Brings Linux Users New Features First"> last release-proper back in January</a>, you won&#8217;t find anything dramatically different in this release, but you will find a new icon, faster start up times, and a handful of other minor fixes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New logo</strong></li>
<li><strong>Faster start-up time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chinese language fixes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ads won&#8217;t bring Spotify to the front any more</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Spotify 0.9.133 isn&#8217;t going to persuade anyone who is not using it already using it to start doing so, but the more ardent Spotifites amongst&#160;you&#160;will likely appreciate it.</p>

<p>Adobe has just announced its first hardware initiative, a pressure sensitive stylus that will tightly integrate with its software applications. The company's Project Mighty stylus was shown off connecting to an iPad via Bluetooth. As demonstrated, the tool was able to carefully create curved and angled shapes in a way that would be difficult to do with existing third-party styluses.</p>

<p>Eric Schmidt is known for singing the internet's praises, but it turns out Google's Chairman also thinks there should be a "delete" button for the web &#8212; some effective way of permanently erasing data once and for all. "The lack of a delete button on the Internet is a significant issue," Schmidt said during an NYU appearance with Jared Cohen, the co-author of his recent book. "There is a time when erasure is a right thing," he said, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.cnet.com%2F8301-1023_3-57583022-93%2Fgoogles-schmidt-the-internet-needs-a-delete-button%2F%3Fpart%3Drss" target="_blank">according to <em>CNET</em>.</a></p>
<p>Without context, it sounds like Schmidt is calling for the creation of some sort of secretive censorship tool. But the executive's reasoning is a bit simpler than that. Schmidt uses the example of a young person &#8212; convicted of a crime later cleared from his or her record &#8212; that could face difficulties finding a job thanks to records of that wrongdoing on the internet. In the eyes of Schmidt, the web can make it nearly impossible to turn over a new leaf. "In America, there's a sense of fairness that's culturally true for all of us," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The video below contains extremely graphic depictions of sexual and violent content, including realistic depictions of mutilation and torture. <strong>DO NOT view if you're uncomfortable with this material.</strong></p>
<p>Way back in 1993, Nine Inch Nails released the <em>Broken</em> EP, perhaps Trent Reznor's most purely aggressive album to date. To go along with the album, Reznor partnered with Peter Christopherson (founding member of industrial music pioneers Throbbing Gristle) to create an incredibly realistic, disturbing, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F6%2F13%2F3076557%2Fsnuff-murder-torture-internet-people-who-watch-it">snuff-style film</a> featuring the music of <em>Broken</em> as its soundtrack. Due to the highly graphic footage in the film, it was never officially released &#8212; though one video for "Happiness in Slavery" included on the 1997 VHS overview <em>Closure</em> gave fans a taste of the horror show contained within the full <em>Broken</em> film. In fact, Reznor was reportedly quoted as saying that the <em>Broken</em> film "makes "Happiness in Slavery" look like a Disney movie."</p>
<p><em>Broken</em> has since seen a number of unofficial releases &#8212; it was widely bootlegged from the original VHS copies, and Trent Reznor himself is believed to have leaked a high-quality DVD disc image on The Pirate Bay in December of 2006. Now, the entire 20-minute <em>Broken</em> film was posted to the NIN Tumblr today, marking the first official release of the controversial and rare footage. If you're interested in seeing what all the fuss was about over the last 20 years, check out the video below &#8212; but be warned: this footage is <em>extremely graphic</em>.</p>

<p>By any reasonable measure, YouTube is one of the web&#8217;s giants. Google announced in March that the site was drawing <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F20%2F4129808%2Fyoutube-hits-a-billion-monthly-viewers">one billion unique viewers</a> a month, and a good video can help lift a performer like Justin Bieber or Psy to offline stardom. Now, YouTube is turning those view counts into a full assault on traditional television. In 2012, it launched partner channels with the likes of Vice and Machinima, and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F6%2F4304276%2Fgoogle-launching-paid-youtube-channels-rumor">new paid channels may be on the horizon.</a> Since last year, Google has even hosted a "Brandcast," own version of television network "upfront" events meant to lure advertisers in for a new season with glitzy performances.</p>
<p>During this year&#8217;s Brandcast, Google brought on big names &#8212; including Macklemore and Snoop Dogg / Lion &#8212; and played up the theme of overtaking TV, frequently quoting a Nielsen finding that YouTube reaches more 18- to 34-year-old viewers in the US than any single cable network. But it also told another story, painting a picture of YouTube as a community of underdog nerds just looking for a voice.</p>
<p><q class="right">Eric Schmidt sells advertisers on 'Generation C'</q></p>
<p>At the Brandcast, Eric Schmidt opens by coining the awkward term "Generation C," a description that works just as poorly as <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F8%2F3850056%2Fqualcomms-insane-ces-2013-keynote-pictures-tweets">Qualcomm&#8217;s "Generation M"</a> to describe connected youth. From there, he quickly cedes the floor to actress and professional geek Felicia Day, whose "Geek &amp; Sundry" channel has just entered its second year. Day frames her move to YouTube in terms of self-expression, showing the audience a younger version of herself dressed as a mime.</p>
<p>"I didn&#8217;t realize the things I were into weren&#8217;t cool," she says, describing how she moved from mainstream Hollywood to the weirder world of YouTube. "Dubstep violinist" Lindsey Stirling echoes Day&#8217;s sentiment, recalling her feelings after being rejected from <em>America&#8217;s Got Talent</em>: it was just "one more person telling people I wasn't good enough." She would go on to make one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2012.</p>

<p>The story YouTube tells is one of outsiders coming home, where they can find a group of like-minded people. After all, far more than traditional television or even video competitors like Hulu, communication is what YouTube has to offer. Videos can be shared endlessly, and YouTube has worked to integrate Google+ social tools. You can "Like" or "Dislike" videos. But most noticeably, readers can talk back in comments or reactions.</p>
<p>Hearing YouTube talk about its comments is almost surreal, like you&#8217;ve stumbled into an alternate universe. In my everyday life, "YouTube comment" is a shorthand for illiterate bigotry or paranoid anger &#8212; the best you can hope when diving into them is that they won&#8217;t actively make your day worse. But at the Brandcast, they&#8217;re everywhere. The image of a cursor blinking over some variation of "I love this!!!" permeates presentations, underscoring what YouTube calls the benefits of working with Generation C.</p>
<p><q class="center">The image of a cursor blinking over some variation of 'I love this!!!' permeates presentations</q></p>
<p>"What I got wrong is that I thought YouTube is like TV," says global head of content Robert Kyncl of his early days with the site. "TV is one-way. YouTube talks back ... TV means reach, YouTube means engagement." Day&#8217;s take is more colorful &#8212; she says that comments (from praise for her show The Guild to comments on her nose) are part of what drew her into YouTube: "&#8216;Show me your boobs!&#8217;" she laughs, paraphrasing one. "I was hooked."</p>
<p><img alt="Xdqwqtz8_imrzlnnguhvwynkvozcmzgg8dfjl61xqik" class="photo" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2587181/XdQwQtz8_IMRzlnNGUHvWYnKvOzCmZgG8dfJl61xQIk.jpg" width="560" /></p>
<p>Many of Day&#8217;s comments are actually positive: there&#8217;s definitely noise, but there&#8217;s also a sense of dedicated fandom. That&#8217;s hardly true across the board on YouTube, though, and even supportive comments rarely add up to a conversation. But their presence gives creators what Kyncl calls "immediate real-time metrics," letting them see which jokes get quoted and what grabs commenters&#8217; attention.</p>
<p><q class="left">"You have to participate in cultural moments."</q></p>
<p>The roughness of comments also points at another of YouTube&#8217;s selling points: "authenticity," a word several speakers use to describe what they brought to the table. "Our fans value authenticity and passion more than anything," says Day. In addition to partnering with YouTube&#8217;s existing artists, advertisers are urged to create their own channels &#8212; but they&#8217;re cautioned to make videos seem organic and responsive, not just standard-issue commercials. "It is about leaning in," Kyncl says, pointing to a <em>Simpsons</em> clip in which characters do the Harlem Shake or a McDonalds video that shows why its burgers always look better in ads. "You have to participate in cultural moments."</p>
<p>YouTube has spent the last few years moving from a home for amateur video clips to a polished destination for professional content, and it&#8217;s trying to get advertising to match, allaying the worries of producers who say they <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F4%2F4062810%2Fyoutube-partners-complain-revenue-sharing-google-ads">aren&#8217;t making enough to cover costs</a>. Now, it&#8217;s doing so by playing on its unfiltered, slightly rough-edged image. The switch in power from TV to streaming has "already happened," says Schmidt. But while fellow streaming site Netflix may be trying to overtake HBO, YouTube wants advertisers to know it&#8217;s never going to be like television.</p>

<p>For Dropbox, adding another 100 million users means integrating with an ever-increasing number of devices and services. For that, it needs an army of willing developers. And while Dropbox already connects with <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fabout" target="_blank">thousands</a> of apps, the company will try to extend its reach by holding its first-ever <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fdbx" target="_blank">DBX developer conference</a> this summer.</p>
<p>The July 9 event, to take place at Fort Mason in San Francisco, will give developers a chance to meet with Dropbox engineers and one another to share ideas about building on the platform. Developers will also "be the first to learn about new products that will make developing on Dropbox even easier," the company <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fdevelopers%2Fblog%2F32" target="_blank">said in a blog post</a>. That could mean a first look at what Dropbox is doing with some of its recent acquisitions, which include <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F12%2F19%2F3785296%2Fdropbox-acquires-snapjoy-photo-aggregation-and-sharing-service">Snapjoy</a> for photo sharing, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F15%2F4108640%2Fdropbox-acquires-email-app-mailbox">Mailbox</a> for email, and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F12%2F13%2F3762456%2Fdropbox-acquires-audiogalaxy-future-cloud-music-service">Audiogalaxy</a> for music.</p>
<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="center">A first look at where Dropbox goes next</q></p>
<p><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.dropboxusercontent.com%2Fu%2F27532820%2Fapp.html">Since it was founded</a>, Dropbox has faced questions over how it will avoid being overtaken by online storage offerings from bigger competitors. But the emergence of SkyDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud have done seemingly little to blunt the company's momentum. (Dropbox still has a long way to go, though, as Steve Ballmer was <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F30%2F3931846%2Fsteve-ballmer-on-small-dropbox-users-interview">happy to note</a>.)</p>
<p>The announcement of DBX comes a few months after Dropbox <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F2%2F6%2F3958230%2Fdropbox-raises-stakes-icloud-google-drive-simpler-api">simplified its developer tools</a>, making it easier for developers to implement Dropbox tools like sync, offline caching, and background uploads without building custom software. And it comes as the company is slowly redefining itself, evolving beyond files and folders to create <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F30%2F3933144%2Fdropbox-unveils-social-photo-sharing-easier-photo-management-and">easier ways to store and view the content</a> users store on the service.</p>
<p>DBX is likely to give the world its first look at where the company goes from here. Developers can request an invitation to the event at <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fdbx" target="_blank">the DBX website</a>.</p>
