<p>After years of focusing on its own content stores, Barnes &amp; Noble has added Google Play support to its Nook tablet line &#8212; turning the Nook HD and Nook HD+ into fairly capable cheap Android tablets. Now, Barnes &amp; Noble has <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fu%2Fnook%2F379003208" target="_blank">knocked down the in-store and online price</a> of both substantially for Mother's Day. From today until May 12th, the 8GB 7-inch Nook HD is selling for $149, down from its usual $199, and a 16GB version (normally $229) is $179. The 9-inch Nook HD+, meanwhile, is $179 for a 16GB version and $209 for a 32GB one, compared to $269 and $299.</p>
<p>As we noted in our reviews, both <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F10%2F30%2F3571394%2Fbarnes-noble-nook-hd-review">the HD</a> and the <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F12%2F12%2F3752910%2Fbarnes-noble-nook-hd-plus-review">HD+ have</a> great displays and design, though this was balanced by poor speakers and a limited selection of apps in Barnes &amp; Noble's curated store. Barnes &amp; Noble has had a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F30%2F4285728%2Fbarnes-noble-uk-nook-ereader-reductions">similar deal running in the UK</a>, and it's instituted fire-sale pricing of its Simple Touch e-reader before. But with full support for Play and Google's app ecosystem just added, there's something to set the Nook apart from competitor Amazon.</p>

<p>Google Glass and its new approach to a constantly-connected lifestyle has already been the butt of a number of jokes, including <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwhitemenwearinggoogleglass.tumblr.com%2F" target="_blank">Tumblr blogs</a> devoted to showing how ridiculous the device can be. On Saturday's new episode of <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, the writers of <em>Weekend Update</em> also got into the fray, with fictional tech blogger Randall Meeks and his new Google Glass joining the news desk to speak to Seth Meyers. <em>SNL's</em> portrayal of Google Glass' awkward head gestures and sometimes unresponsive voice commands is funny to watch, and frankly, not that far off from what it's actually like to use Glass. You can check out the clip below and get an idea of what others might think when they see people using Google Glass out in public.</p>

<p>I overheard an interesting conversation about Iceland last Saturday night. My children&#8217;s literature teacher, from a couple semesters back, just happened to be at a bar I was at, and was quite passionately giving a speech about the Icelandic people and their belief in elves. Yep, you read that right, elves. Those fairytale creatures that most of us grew up with, or read about in Lord of the Rings. A breed of beings that are commonly depicted as miniature humans, rumored to have pointy ears, and supposedly live on rocky terrain. </p>
<p>Elves are a part of Celtic folklore, and the people of Iceland regard them with respect. When I overheard my old teacher, he was discussing how pieces of land are often protected in Iceland because elves are believed to inhabit particular areas. Scheduled building-projects frequently cease in Iceland because of them.</p>
<p>Some of you may be thinking that this tradition is lunacy. Why would we stop the progress of our society for a group of mythical beings? But this folk tale seems to have at least helped a little with the human problem of over-development. And keeping alive a source of magic and wonder can&#8217;t be bad for the country&#8217;s morale. No, I think we should thank the elves for contributing to the preservation of this beautiful country. For the sake of its wildlife and culture.   </p>
<p>But, back to why you&#8217;re here&#8211;the infographic! Here&#8217;s ten reasons why you should visit the magical land of Iceland as soon as possible! <a href="http://lindanakanishi.com/project/infographic-on-reykjavik/" target="_blank">[Via]</a></p>

<p>We all know the feeling. You're sleepless in the sad hours of the night or stumbling around early on a hazy weekend morning in need of something to read, and that pile of unread books just isn't cutting it. Why not take a break from the fire hose of Twitter and RSS and check out our weekly roundup of essential writing from around the web about technology, culture, media, and the future? Sure, it's one more thing you can feel guilty about sitting in your Instapaper queue, but it's better than pulling in vain on your Twitter list again.</p>

<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><h2>On Y Combinator</h2>
<p>Nathaniel Rich follows several teams through the preparation and pitching sessions for the stressful Demo Day of famed startup accelerator Y Combinator.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em>: Nathaniel Rich - <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F05%2F05%2Fmagazine%2Fy-combinator-silicon-valleys-start-up-machine.html%3Fpartner%3Drss%26amp%3Bemc%3Drss%26amp%3B_r%3D0">Silicon Valley&#8217;s Start-Up Machine</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We&#8217;re in the early days of the Internet," Buchheit said. "Every other industry will be eaten by tech." This conviction, more than any other, explains the feeding frenzy that occurs on Y.C.&#8217;s Demo Day. If there&#8217;s going to be another Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and anyone can be Sergey and Larry, then it&#8217;s only logical for investors to bet on as many founders as possible. You can&#8217;t win the game unless you ante up.</p>

<h2>On cinema</h2>
<p>The <em>Deadline</em> team has director Steven Soderbergh's full keynote at the recent San Francisco International Film Festival.</p>
<p><em>Deadline Hollywood</em>: <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deadline.com%2F2013%2F04%2Fsteven-soderbergh-state-of-cinema-address%2F">Steven Soderbergh&#8217;s State Of Cinema Talk</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, how does a studio decide what movies get made? One thing they take into consideration is the foreign market, obviously. It&#8217;s become very big. So that means, you know, things that travel best are going to be action-adventure, science fiction, fantasy, spectacle, some animation thrown in there. Obviously the bigger the budget, the more people this thing is going to have to appeal to, the more homogenized it&#8217;s got to be, the more simplified it&#8217;s got to be. So things like cultural specificity and narrative complexity, and, god forbid, ambiguity, those become real obstacles to the success of the film here and abroad.</p>

<h2>On tacos</h2>
<p>Austin Carr has the story on the handshake agreement that let to the Doritos cheese-dusted Taco Bell taco synergy.</p>
<p><em>Fast Company</em>: Austin Carr - <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2F3008346%2Fdeep-inside-taco-bells-doritos-locos-taco%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter">Deep Inside Taco Bell's Doritos Locos taco</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like any serious renovation, Taco Bell&#8217;s started with a trip to Home Depot. It was April 2009. To show executives how the companies could fuse the flavor of Doritos with taco shells, the dev teams "basically went out to Home Depot to buy a paint-spray gun, and then sprayed [Doritos] flavoring onto our existing yellow corn tacos," recalls Creed, with a chuckle. "It was pretty funny watching people from behind glass spraying our tacos with a paint gun. But it was enough for us to know conceptually that we had a big idea."</p>

<h2>On the Y-12 intrusion</h2>
<p>Dan Zak writes the story of how three peace activists (a nun, a drifter, and a house painter) penetrated the defenses of US nuclear-weapons facility Y-12, the "Fort Knox of Uranium."</p>
<p><em>The Washington Post</em>: Dan Zak - <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsf%2Fstyle%2F2013%2F04%2F29%2Fthe-prophets-of-oak-ridge%2F">The Prophets of Oak Ridge</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now there she was, an old lady in sturdy shoes, reaching the limits of her mortal energy at the top of Pine Ridge with Greg, about 90 minutes into the mission. There was the vista over which the Prophet of Oak Ridge had prayed more than a century before, where a national security complex now winked in the darkness.</p>

<h2>On spaceship Baltimore</h2>
<p>Ron Miller describes the history behind Baltimore's Robert Condit and the rocket he built in 1928.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Baltimore rocket was fueled with 50 gallons of gasoline with eight steel pipes for engines. The several layers of sailcloth that covered the rocket were impregnated with varnish making an airtight shell "as brittle as glass." The nose section unscrewed to allow the rocket&#8217;s single passenger ingress.</p>

<p>A documentary purporting to unveil outlandish UFO coverups may have one legitimate target in its sights: the skeleton of a bizarre, alien-like humanoid that was unearthed in Chile about a decade ago. A <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.estrellaiquique.cl%2Fsite%2Fapg%2Freportajes%2Fpags%2F20031019040110.html" target="_blank">2003 report</a> from a Chilean newspaper confirms that <em>something</em> was found, but there doesn't appear to be any research in the decade that followed &#8212; at least, until the filmmakers behind <em>Sirius</em> became involved.</p>
<p>Now, two researchers from Stanford have actually taken up the task of examining the remains, and much to everyone's surprise, they told <em>LiveScience</em> that it was human. The creature is said to be six inches tall and have lived to between six and eight years old, but apparently no series of mutations can fully explain its diminutive form. <a class="c2" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2F29176-alien-looking-skeleton-poses-medical-mystery.html%3Fcmpid%3D514645" target="_blank"><em>LiveScience</em> has all of the details</a> on Nolan's research &#8212; but we're not ruling it out as one elaborate and creepy hoax.</p>

<p>Hybrid car sales in the US have been dominated by Toyota's Prius family &#8212; but that could be changing as demand for Ford's Fusion and C-Max hybrids continues to sharply rise. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2F2013-05-03%2Fford-to-pass-hybrid-sales-record-in-five-months-on-fusion-c-max.html" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that</a> the automaker's share of US hybrid vehicle sales rose from three percent in April 2012 to 18 percent last month. Though Toyota still took in over half of April's sales, it's the only manufacturer ahead of Ford at this point. Ford is also on track to beat its own record for yearly hybrid sales &#8212; 35,496 vehicles &#8212; sometime this month.</p>
<p>Even so, it still has a ways to go to catch up with Toyota. Last year, the Japanese automaker sold over 236,000 hybrids in the US, and according to <em>Bloomberg</em> it expects to sell more than that in 2013. Sales of hybrid cars haven't been taking off for every company, however. Last year, GM <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F3%2F4%2F2843549%2Fchevy-volt-production-stop-poor-sales-gm">decided to temporarily halt production</a> of its Chevy Volt, after the vehicle didn't sell as well as expected, and this year could see lower numbers for hybrids overall. <em>Bloomberg</em> reports that Toyota's CEO for North America has suggested that reduced gas prices may be curbing interest in the Prius, a problem which could also impact broader demand for hybrid cars.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of selling ebooks <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F4%2F24%2F2973132%2Fmacmillan-tor-forge-drm-free-ebooks">free of DRM copy protection</a>, Macmillan subsidiary Tor Books UK said that it has seen no increase in piracy on any of its properties. The company's editorial director elaborated in <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tor.com%2Fblogs%2F2013%2F04%2Ftor-books-uk-drm-free-one-year-later" target="_blank">an extensive reflection</a> on the decision earlier this week, writing, "The move has been a hugely positive one for us, [...] we&#8217;re still pleased that we took this step." The science fiction and fantasy publisher officially made the change last July alongside its American sister company, noting that their audiences were too technically savvy to be forced to deal with the limitations of DRM.</p>
<p>Though Tor Books UK's editorial director noted that the decision was met with significant support by its authors and customers, it hasn't seen the same positive response from its competitors. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fbusiness%2F2012%2F08%2Fhachette-uk-tries-to-pressure-tor-books-into-reintroducing-e-book-drm%2F" target="_blank"><em>Ars Technica</em> points</a> to <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publishersweekly.com%2Fpw%2Fby-topic%2Fcolumns-and-blogs%2Fcory-doctorow%2Farticle%2F53544-doubling-down-on-drm.html" target="_blank">a <em>Publishers Weekly</em> article</a> on an industry rival that reportedly tried to have Tor reverse its decision. A subsidiary of Hachette Book Group allegedly suggested that some Tor Books authors should pressure the company to once again use DRM &#8212; the reasoning being that it could hurt sales in other regions where different companies owned the book rights. Tor Books seemingly has no intention of backing down, but it doesn't look like its position on DRM is catching on with the rest of the industry.</p>

<p>Twitter has become an integral part of the way we use the web on a daily basis, and any service with that kind of popularity is going to be a target for hackers. Malicious individuals taking over people's Twitter accounts seems to have become an all-too-regular occurrence lately, with everyone from Burger King to the Associated Press having their respective accounts commandeered. You can follow the ongoing struggles &#8212;&#160;and Twitter's attempts to solve the problems &#8212;&#160;right here.</p>

<p>Earlier this week we reported that users had been complaining about a certain feature from the app Path: namely, that its default behavior was to <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F30%2F4286090%2Fpath-is-spamming-address-books-with-unwanted-texts-and-robocalls">automatically send text messages</a> out to people a user may know when they first signed up with the app. The Path app has now received an update that removes the ability to find Facebook friends altogether, and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2013%2F05%2F04%2Fpath-blocked%2F" target="_blank"><em>TechCrunch</em> reports</a> that it's due to Facebook restricting Path's access to its API. Users can still share any items they post to Facebook, but any friend-associated activity has disappeared.</p>
<p>The spamming behavior first went into effect with a March 6th update to the app. It gained traction when a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F30%2F4286090%2Fpath-is-spamming-address-books-with-unwanted-texts-and-robocalls">digital marketer named Stephen Kenwright</a> signed up with the app, and discovered that multiple individuals from his contacts received Path text notification early the next morning &#8212; even though he'd subsequently deleted the app on his own device. In that particular case, some of the texts manifested as robocalls due to the way local phone companies dealt with text messages sent to landlines.</p>
<p><q class="right">It's not the first time this kind of thing has happened</q></p>
<p>It's not the first time Facebook has pulled the plug on the friend-finding API for an app. Something similar <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F16%2F4111296%2Ffacebook-reportedly-kills-friend-finding-for-group-messaging-competitor-messageme">happened with MessageMe</a> earlier this year, and everything <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F24%2F3913082%2Ffacebook-has-apparently-blocked-vines-friend-finding-feature">from Vine</a> to Voxer has faced similar problems. As it currently stands, the Path app allows users to find friends through three different means: their device's contacts, through Twitter, of via their Gmail account. It's important to note that during the sign-up process finding friends through one's contacts still defaults to the "send to all" behavior, and users will need to be cautious when signing up with Path to avoid sending alerts if that's not their intention. Finding friends via Twitter does not default to this behavior &#8212; though Path will send a Twitter direct message to any user you choose to invite.</p>

<p>Acer is clearly and closely aligned with Windows, but there's one part of Microsoft's strategy it's not buying into just yet. At an event on Friday in New York &#8212; in the middle of a sea of <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F5%2F3%2F4296482%2Facers-aspire-r7-combines-desktop-laptop-and-tablet-with-one-floating">newly-announced Windows products</a> &#8212; company President Jim Wong <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F2037464%2Facer-waits-for-windows-rt-81-to-make-tablet-decision.html">told <em>PCWorld</em></a> that Acer won't build a Windows RT tablet until Windows RT 8.1 comes out. "To be honest, there's no value doing the current version of RT," he said. We may not have to wait long, though: Wong also alluded to Windows RT 8.1 coming in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>Acer has a fairly turbulent history with Windows RT, but has repeatedly said it's <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F8%2F17%2F3248115%2Facer-committed-to-developing-windows-rt-hardware">committed to building products</a> with Microsoft's low-powered OS.

<p>Malaysia holds its national election this Sunday, pitting the ruling National Front party against an unusually strong People's Alliance coalition in what observers are calling <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F05%2F04%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fopposition-in-tight-race-to-take-power-in-malaysian-election.html" target="new">the most closely contested race in the nation's history</a>. But as citizens head to the polls, the country has seen a flood of ISP blocks and DDoS actions against opposition sites and independent media.</p>
<p>The most visible actions are DDoS attacks, a technique that floods sites with bogus traffic, making them inaccessible to normal users. It's a technique <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F1%2F28%2F3924248%2Fddos-how-a-tool-built-by-web-activists-became-the-ultimate-weapon-for">often aimed at opposition parties</a> in the days leading up to an election. DDoS mitigation service Cloudflare told <em>The Verge</em> it has seen several news organization come under attack in the past week, and that the vast majority of the actions have been <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.cloudflare.com%2Fsaturday-night-fever-layer-7-attacks-against" target="new">Layer 7 attacks</a> originating from within the country. It strongly suggests that whoever's behind the attack is local.</p>
<p><q class="left">Opposition party Facebook pages were also targeted by the blocks</q></p>
<p>Alongside the denial-of-service attacks, Malaysian ISPs have instituted a more sophisticated kind of web censorship. <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessnow.org%2Fblog%2F2013%2F05%2F02%2Ftracking-network-interference-malaysia" target="new">An Access Now report</a> detailed five Malaysian ISPs that had begun blocking domains, simply refusing to serve requests made to certain web addresses. After early complaints, ISPs also blocked specific content within those domains that was critical of the standing regime. In one example, the blocks targeted a specific YouTube video seen as damaging to the regime, targeting the "return" stream rather than the user request to make it seem as if YouTube's servers were the source of the problem. Opposition party <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrands%2Ffacebook%2F504">Facebook</a> pages were also targeted by the blocks. Based on the nature of the interference, Access suspects the ruling party is instituting the blocks using deep packet inspection, with the assistance of the (supposedly independent) ISPs.</p>
<p>"We're used to seeing DDoS and hacking attacks prior to elections, but in this case they're doing a lot more, like arresting bloggers for old posts and jamming radio stations," said Gustaf Bjorksten, technology director at Access Now. "There seems to be very little they won't do to stop information they don't like."</p>

<p>I just got done mentioning <a href="http://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/cdcd-another-in-a-long-list-of-clever-cd-player-names/" title="cdcd: With a name like that&#160;&#8230;">cdcd</a>, so I should probably mention this one and hope I&#8217;ve covered them all: <a href="http://dcdplayer.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">dcd</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2013-03-31-solo-2150-dcd.png"><img alt="2013-03-31-solo-2150-dcd" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1288" height="112" src="http://inconsolation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2013-03-31-solo-2150-dcd.png?w=150&#038;h=112" width="150" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, another console CD player, although this one is slightly different.</p>
<p>Whereas <a href="https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/jac-from-a-bygone-era/" target="_blank">jac</a>, cdcd and even <a href="http://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/adcd-your-basic-cd-player/" target="_blank" title="adcd: Your basic CD&#160;player">adcd</a> all monopolize a terminal prompt to work, dcd releases your terminal for other purposes while it runs.</p>
<p>Whether that&#8217;s good or bad is for you to decide. It does mean dcd doesn&#8217;t have much in the way of an interface, and I just got done saying I prefer visual applications.</p>
<p>But it does mean that for a background job, like playing a CD, you can do as well to instruct it to start playing, and then go back to what you were doing.</p>

<p>Earlier this week <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F29%2F4283854%2Ftwitter-warns-news-organizations-about-ongoing-hacking-threats">Twitter sent out a memo to news outlets</a>, suggesting ways in which they could keep their accounts safe from hackers &#8212; but the official account for <em>E! Online</em> appears to have been hacked nonetheless. Earlier today, the account &#8212; which goes <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Feonline" target="_blank">under the handle @eonline</a> &#8212; posted several tweets attributing false statements to Justin Bieber. The Twitter account is currently suspended.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dsyrian%2Belectronic%2Barmy%2Bwas%2Bhere" target="_blank">retweets and images currently circulating</a>, a later tweet from @eonline named the Syrian Electronic Army as the party responsible for the self-described troll. A group going by the same name has claimed to be behind the takeover of several other high-profile Twitter accounts and websites, including ones connected to <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F16%2F4230182%2Fnpr-reports-website-and-twitter-accounts-were-defaced-by-syrian">NPR</a>, <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F20%2F4246690%2Fcbs-twitter-hijack-syria">CBS</a>, and <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F29%2F4282202%2Fthe-guardian-falls-victim-syrian-electronic-army-11-twitter-accounts-hacked"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. Twitter's warning earlier this week was seen as a response to recent attacks; today's incident just underscores the need for stricter security measures &#8212; not to mention a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F4%2F23%2F4259342%2Ftwitter-reportedly-working-on-two-factor-authentication">two-factor authentication method for Twitter itself</a>&#8212; that much more.</p>

<p>Well, I've just started Neuromancer again, and we've been dropped into the Japanese underworld with hustler and former hacker Case. There's a lot to keep track of: a mix of real and imagined companies, a style of neologism-making that hints at the larger world ("French orbital fatigues"), and a cast of noir archetypes repurposed for science fiction. Its tone has become a genre in itself, but it's also in some ways a great deal like <em>Blade Runner,</em> which came out two years before <em>Neuromancer</em> was published (1982 v. 1984.)</p>
<p><a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.williamgibsonbooks.com%2Farchive%2F2003_01_17_archive.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">William Gibson has said</a> that he saw <em>Blade Runner</em> when he was about a third of the way through writing <em>Neuromancer</em> and actually walked out of the theater about 20 minutes in. "I figured my unfinished first novel was sunk, done for. Everyone would assume I'd copped my visual texture from this astonishingly fine-looking film. But that didn't happen. Mainly I think because <em>BLADERUNNER</em> seriously bombed in theatrical release, and films didn't pop right back out on DVD in those days." The two also share a view of Japan as the economic and cultural power of the future, something that has always struck me as an odd piece of historical specificity, as someone who grew up in the '90s and early '00s when China was more visible.</p>
<p>Narratively, Gibson has also listed <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fproject.cyberpunk.ru%2Fidb%2Fgibson_interview.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Escape from New York</em> as an influence</a>. "I saw that movie, by the way, when I was starting 'Burning Chrome' and it had a real influence on <em>Neuromancer.</em> I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake: 'You flew the wing-five over Leningrad, didn't you?' It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF, where a casual reference can imply a lot." That's one of the great strengths of <em>Neuromancer</em> to me<em>:</em> it implies a huge world by focusing on details.</p>
<p>That also means that the book is incredibly dense with references, something that I've always found rather beautiful. Reading the first few pages over again, I realized that a lot of the imagery and turns of phrase from <em>Neuromancer</em> have made it into my daily life &#8212; Linda Lee playing in the arcade, for example, is the semi-conscious prototype I use when imagining <em>any</em> arcade. Does it work for other people, or have the images and styles become so frequently used in pop culture since 1984 that they've become cliche?</p>

<p>Just under two years ago, HTC's CEO responded to public pressure by making an <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2011%2F05%2F26%2Fhtc-unlocked-bootloaders%2F">equally public promise</a>: "We will no longer be locking the bootloaders on our devices." Today, that promise is only half-kept by HTC, while other manufacturers have an even spottier record when it comes to keeping the Android ecosystem as "open" as its intended reputation. The bootloaders are locked, and the carriers are holding the keys.</p>
<p>The bootloader, if you're unfamiliar, is basically the low-level bit of software on a computer that allows the rest of the operating system to start up &#8212; a nerdy little piece of code that turns out to be important if you want to tinker with the phone to make it do what you want. If the bootloader is locked, you can't put your own operating system on the phone; if it's unlocked, you're <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F11%2F20%2F3666668%2Faccess-denied-android-unlocked-bootloaders">free to delve into the life-extending and carrier-free world of custom ROMs</a>.</p>

<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="right">The carriers are holding the keys</q></p>
<p>Now that the biggest flagship Android phones of 2013 are out and available, we thought we'd check in on the state of their bootloaders. As you've probably guessed by now, it's not a pretty picture &#8212; so far as we know, the major carriers in the US by-and-large continue to force manufacturers to lock the bootloaders on their phones.</p>
<p>However, the situation is not quite as dire as it sounds. Samsung has occasionally created "developer editions" of its flagship phones with unlocked bootloaders, though it generally offers them at a later date. HTC and Sony both have done the same. Developer editions are not ideal solutions &#8212; they are full-priced, unsubsidized phones and not always available on your carrier &#8212; but they're at least an option. Android hackers are also adept at finding ways to unlock bootloaders despite the carrier&#8217;s best efforts. Even Motorola&#8217;s famously locked-down handsets have <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.azimuthsecurity.com%2F2013%2F04%2Funlocking-motorola-bootloader.html">recently been opened up</a> and there's <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fdjrbliss%2Fstatus%2F329617760252481537" target="_blank">hints that the Galaxy S4's locked bootloader is also hackable</a>.</p>
<p>HTC has also <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2011%2F08%2F15%2Fhtc-bootloader-unlocking-tool-european-htc-sensation%2F">created a system wherein you can register your phone's unique identifier</a> and then receive an unlock key. That system still applies today to the HTC One &#8212; most customers can visit HTC's site and get the code to unlock their bootloaders. HTC keeps a record of which phones have been unlocked just in case it comes up in a warranty situation, the company says, though it hasn't shared that data with the carriers.</p>
<p>When we asked Samsung which of its phones were locked, the company simply wouldn't say &#8212; we were directed to ask each carrier individually. HTC tells <em>The Verge</em> that two carriers out of the over 185 that are carrying the One have blocked unlocking. HTC would not say <em>which</em> two carriers have blacklisted the One from being unlocked, though.</p>
<p><q class="left">The two most likely candidates are also the two most obvious ones</q></p>
<p>So we asked around and discovered that the two most likely candidates are also the two most obvious ones: AT&amp;T and Verizon. The bootloader is locked on both the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One on both carriers. Verizon has yet to actually announce that it will carry the One, but <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2013%2F3%2F13%2F4099276%2Fhtc-one-reportedly-coming-to-verizon-later-this-year">rumors strongly suggest</a> that it will. We asked Verizon <em>why</em> it continued to lock the bootloader on Android phones and the answer we received is the same we heard back in November: to ensure an "outstanding user experience." Here's what Verizon has to say about bootloaders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our position on open bootloaders doesn't change with the phone. Customers expect a certain level of service from us. Any time a device is modified which can happen with an open bootloader, we cannot guarantee device performance, security, or the outstanding user experience our customers have come to expect. Additionally, Verizon takes device security very seriously and an open bootloader can compromise the security of the device. A secure bootloader does not deny, limit, or restrict a customer from accessing or downloading applications using the device capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<table><tbody><tr><th></th>
<th>HTC One</th>
<th>Samsung Galaxy S4</th>
</tr><tr><td>Verizon</td>
<td>Locked, unlock blacklisted (rumored)</td>
<td>Locked</td>
</tr><tr><td>AT&amp;T</td>
<td>Locked, unlock blacklisted</td>
<td>Locked</td>
</tr><tr><td>Sprint</td>
<td>Unlockable</td>
<td>Unlocked</td>
</tr><tr><td>T-Mobile</td>
<td>Unlockable</td>
<td>Locked</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>As is often the case, the underdogs are more willing to tout openness amongst the big four US carriers. Sprint and T-Mobile are more supportive of HTC's program to unlock the bootloader. Sprint says that the bootloader can be unlocked on the HTC One and the Galaxy S4 comes unlocked. T-Mobile says that the bootloaders on both the HTC One and the Galaxy S4 are locked, but that it won&#8217;t prevent customers from unlocking them. It also gave us a rather un-un-carrier statement about bootloaders that mirrored Verizon&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>T-Mobile does not prevent customers from unlocking the bootloader; however, we are committed to delivering an optimal experience on our devices for T-Mobile customers, and the installation of unauthorized firmware can negatively impact that experience. Additionally, this will help prevent device fraud, as well as security threats that may result from third-party firmware that has not been tested by T-Mobile and its OEM partners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><q class="right">Open for business, not users</q></p>
<p>So the current state of openness on Android, at least for the two big-name manufacturers, is a mixed bag. The largest carriers continue to keep their devices locked down as much as possible, while the smaller carriers are slightly more willing to let tinkerers and hackers dig in.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing of all &#8212; or perhaps it's not really all that surprising &#8212; is that neither HTC nor Samsung are even willing to go on the record about exactly what the software controls are on the devices they make. The classic complaint about Android's so-called "openness" is that it's open to the carriers, not to the consumers. Though we've made some progress, we're not there yet: the flagship Android phones of 2013 are still being locked down by the flagship carriers.</p>

<p>Researchers in Germany have developed new <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fraunhofer.de%2Fen%2Fpress%2Fresearch-news%2F2013%2Fmay%2Fglove-shows-its-true-colors.html" target="_blank">color-changing gloves</a> designed to alert lab workers to the presence of invisible toxic chemicals. Created by scientists at the Fraunhofer Research Institution for Modular Solid State Technologies EMFT in Regensburg, the protective gloves are embedded with a special dye that turns blue whenever toxic substances are in the air.</p>
<p>The idea, researchers say, is to provide scientists or factory workers with a simple and straightforward alert system. The gloves could also provide a more energy efficient alternative to the heat imaging systems or electronic sensors currently used to detect airborne toxins. Dr. Sabine Trupp, head of the Fraunhofer EMFT Sensor Materials group, says the dye's composition could be tweaked to detect different substances, noting that the technology has a potentially vast array of applications.</p>
<hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break" /><p><q class="right">A world of possibilities</q></p>
<p>"By synthesizing the adapted color sensor materials, we can detect gases like carbon monoxide, for example, or hydrogen sulfide," Trupp said in a press release published this week. "Still, this protective gear represents only one potential area of application. Sensor materials could also be deployed for the quick detection of leaks in gas lines."</p>
<p>The primary challenge researchers faced was figuring out a way to integrate the dye such that it wouldn't disintegrate or dilute when washed. It's not clear if the gloves will see a wide deployment anytime soon, but Trupp and her colleagues are already envisioning new ways they could be used. An integrated sensor module, for example, could keep track of chemical exposure over extended periods, while similar systems could be used in food packaging materials, providing a clearer way to identify spoiled or rotten groceries.</p>

<p>I recently ordered a new batch of Arch Linux laptop stickers. However, because they have been selling so well, I ordered three times the number that I usually stock! I was able to get a much better price by ordering a larger bulk quantity and I&#8217;m excited to pass the savings onto all the loyal Arch Linux users out there.</p>
<p>The price for a single Arch Linux Sticker has dropped from $1.90 to $1.35. The savings are even greater if you purchase in bulk; you can now order 20 stickers for 80 cents a piece!</p>

<p>Well as a CS student at my local community college here in Lakewood, Colorado. I noticed in my CS class that I am&#160; the only black man in the class. I was curious how come the Open Source World did not reach out to more urban males? I have been in touch with some good people at GNOME in particular the OPW program which is for women. Now they have given me good advice to look at GSOC. Can I ask why is there not a similar program for minorities I know this may not apply to all countries. I am talking in particular the US where I am based at. I have in the past been a contributor to Fedora and Arch Linux. I would like some more feedback on any programs for CS majors like myself or even school age children from the inner-city. This is good way to spark interest in the next generation of software engineers.</p>

<p class="itembyline">
by Dusty Phillips
in <a href="http://archlinux.me">Arch Linux User Blogs</a>

</div>
<div class="itemdescription" id="item52855b06">
<p>From a gender equality point of view, I&#8217;d call Pycon 2013 a success, though perhaps a better word is &#8220;progress&#8221;. The gender ratio apparently doubled to 20% this year. If that continues (depending if it&#8217;s a constant, linear, or quadratic curve) we could be at parity in as little as two to three years.</p>
<p>Another indicator of forward momentum is that women this year were able to behave, to use a sexist term, &#8220;like women,&#8221; without fear of reprisal. That is to say, I saw makeup, heels, and skirts, and they did not seem out of place. This is not to suggest that women should or must dress up to attend conferences; the traditional vendorware is equally acceptable for all genders. However, it is progress that more women felt they had a choice in the matter and did not feel an obligation hide their physical differences. I think the fact that there was more variety among the male dress styles is also a sign of success.</p>
<p>The worst charges coming out of Pycon 2013 were the use of inappropriate jokes. To the best of my knowledge, there were no reports of women being harassed, assaulted, or groped during the conference. I&#8217;m not aware that this has been an issue at past Pycons either, but I think it&#8217;s a sign that the Python community is better behaved in this regard than some of her sister tech conferences.</p>
<p>So all in all, while it wasn&#8217;t completely successful, Pycon 2013 was a terrific step on the road to eliminating sexism and creating gender equality. Let&#8217;s make next year an equal sized step. Here are a few topics I think we, as a community, can work on to engender further progress.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start with a couple links. Ruth Burr wrote a terrific essay titled <a href="http://www.ruthburr.com/things-you-think-arent-sexist/">Things You Think Aren&#8217;t Sexist, But Really Are</a> a couple weeks ago. In summary: Men, you are instructed to go to conferences to network and interact, not to date or hook up.</p>
<p>Yes, you might <a href="http://pydanny.com/two-years-ago-today.html">meet the love of your life</a> at Pycon, but don&#8217;t expect, intend, or plan for that to happen (at PyCon or anywhere). Behave professionally, and consider each woman you meet for her knowledge and intelligence, not her figure or her marital status, just as you would when interacting with a male.</p>
<p>Ned Batchelder, with his amazing talent for understanding and explaining problems wrote another <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201303/community_conduct_conflict_and_communication.html">great article</a> on the root issues. Summarized, he says friction is inevitable, and that education is better than shunning when people make mistakes.</p>
<p>I started planning this article while attending Pycon this year. I had to scrap those plans after the so-memed &#8220;donglegate&#8221; fiasco. I don&#8217;t have anything to add to that discussion, but as Ned illustrated, there were many many instances of similarly inappropriate comments at Pycon. I myself made such a joke, most of my friends did so, I overheard a conference organizer say something inappropriate. This is not sexism per se, but sexual and other potentially offensive comments need to be reduced. Comments laced with sexual innuendo do not belong in a professional or a family setting, and Pycon is intended to be both.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with interation between the genders. In her article, Ruth Burr mentioned that women can feel awkward when they interact with men because the men assume they are flirting rather than interested in the topic at hand. Many men see cleavage and assume the speaker can&#8217;t possibly know as much as them about whatever topic that is. Some girls avoid interacting with men because of this awkward sensation, and if they do, the interactions are tainted.</p>
<p>I had a related problem. While I comfortably talked to men of varying skill levels at Pycon, I felt uncomfortable addressing women because I was afraid of sending some vibe that I was being flirtatious. So I tended to ignore the female attendees. This is unfortunate for everyone who missed out on that potential conversation. Pycon 2014 needs to increase the interaction between the genders, not just the attendance ratios. Ladies, talk to the shy guys, they need to be taught that you aren&#8217;t that intimidating. Guys, talk to the women, they need to learn that we are interested in what they have to say about tech, and not their figures. As it stands, only the sexist guys are interacting with the women, and it makes us all look bad.</p>
<p>The gender ratio really fell during the developer sprints. I don&#8217;t think there were any female sprint leaders presenting projects to hack on. Worse, I&#8217;d estimate between one and two percent of the sprint attendees were women. This is a huge area for improvement. To the various diversity groups out there, please encourage your members to stay an extra day or two and attend the Pycon dev sprints. Get them involved with <a href="https://openhatch.org/">Open Hatch</a> if they are unsure how to contribute to open source projects. Sprint leaders, make sure female attendees are welcome, especially if they are new coders (indeed, make all new coders welcome).</p>
<p>I noticed a lot of <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Impostor syndrome</a> among the female attendees and speakers. Programming really is easy. The fact that you enjoy it and find it quite simple is not a sign that you don&#8217;t know the &#8220;hard stuff&#8221; and therefore you&#8217;re not a &#8220;real programmer.&#8221; Quite the reverse, in fact. It&#8217;s not necessary to apologize for your lack of knowledge if you&#8217;ve been invited to do a talk or are about to join an open source project for the first time. Find ways to build your confidence (contributing to open source and getting feedback is a great start), and start believing in your skills. Even if you don&#8217;t believe it yourself, try to project confidence in your coding abilities; it will send a much more effective signal that women are capable and here to stay. Don&#8217;t worry if you over-present yourself; faking your way through it is a great way to find out that you&#8217;re actually better than you thought!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to close with an admonishment to those people who open their articles on sexism with a discussion of their gender. These usually take one of two forms: the disclaimer and the shocker. The disclaimer is most often used by men and sounds like, &#8220;I am a privileged white male so I don&#8217;t understand what it&#8217;s like for women, but I still think I have something valid to say on this topic&#8221;. The shocker is used by both genders and sounds like, &#8220;I am a man/woman, so you&#8217;re going to be amazed that my opinion on this topic is different from other members of my gender.&#8221; Yes, it is useful to state your bias and frame of reference. However, be cautious that your purpose in doing so is to remove distortion from the lens you are applying to the discussion, not to add to it.</p>
<p>And now, feel free to analyze my bias in this article. I am a privileged white male from a blue-collar family. I&#8217;ve had many amazing opportunities in the tech industry. I have very little experience as the target of discrimination, outside my mental illness. My interest in feminist issues comes from my sister&#8217;s master&#8217;s degree on the subject; I proofread most of her undergraduate and graduate level essays, and gained a relatively deep understanding of the topic. I acknowledge that I am a racist, sexist jerk by culture and conditioning. Sometimes I forget to compensate for that. I find it exceptionally easy to overlook the patriarchy when it&#8217;s doing me favors, and I will never be as keenly aware of its negative impact as someone who is directly experiencing it every day.</p>

<p>At the two previous Pycons I&#8217;ve attended (2009 and 2012), Guido Van Rossum&#8217;s keynotes sounded bored and uninterested, even though the content was meaningful. I was actually wondering if this would be the year that he would step down from BDFL of Python. Thankfully, I was dead wrong.</p>
<p>Instead, he presented a highly technical and very exciting addition to the Python language. <a href="http://www.alfredodeza.com/">Alfredo</a> told me this started when he took a month off between stepping down at Google and starting at DropBox. Now, when normal people take a month off, they relax or travel or visit friends and family. Not our BDFL. He writes a callback-free asynchronous event loop API and reference implementation that is expected to massively alleviate Python&#8217;s oft-maligned lack of a consistent, unhackish concurrency solution.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have more of that. What if Mr. Van Rossum could hack on Python full time? Would we see quantum progress in Python every month?</p>
<p>Anyone who knows about the <a href="http://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> project likely thinks they can guess where this is going. We, the people, can each tip our BDFL a few cents or dollars per week so he can focus on whatever he deems worthy. It&#8217;s safe to assume that a man who spends his vacation time drafting a new Python library would choose to work on Python full time if we funded him.</p>
<p>This plan is great, and I actually think that Guido could easily earn enough to quit his day job if he endorsed Gittip and invited individuals to tip him. But I&#8217;d like to discuss a different plan: Not individuals, but companies should tip Guido the maximum gittip amount as a sort of &#8220;partial salary&#8221;. At $1248 per year, most companies wouldn&#8217;t even notice this expense, and they would get a better programming language and standard library in return. The rate of accelerated development would be even higher if each of these companies chose to invest an entire salary, split between a hundred Python core and library developers. If a hundred companies chose to do this, those hundred people could work on Python full time. The language and library would improve so vastly and so rapidly that the return on investment for each of those companies would be far greater than if they had paid that same salary to a single developer working on their in-house product, full time.</p>
<p>It might take some convincing to justify such a strategy to these corporations. Companies tend to like to know what is happening to their money, and simply throwing a hefty developer salary at Gittip would be hard to justify. Obviously &#8220;goodwill&#8221; could support some of it, in the same way that so many companies sponsored Pycon in exchange for exposure.</p>
<p>Cutthroat CEOs should perhaps consider not just the value that having Guido working exclusively on Python is, but also the cost of having him work for the competition. I&#8217;m sure Box.com CEO Aaron Levie was a little nervous when he found out that the first and greatest Python programmer of all time had recently hired on at a major competitor. Perhaps Box.com can&#8217;t afford to steal Guido from Dropbox, but if all the companies currently involved in cloud storage were to tip Guido $24 per week on Gittip, this incredible programmer could be working on an open source product that directly and indirectly benefits their company rather than improving the competing product on a full-time basis.</p>
<p>Most of the arguments that Gittip will fail are based on the premise that not enough money can be injected into the platform to sustain full time development by open source programmers. However, if an open and caring relationship can be built such that the corporate world is also funding the system, I think it can become extremely successful. Everyone will benefit: Open source projects will improve at a rapid pace. Exceptional developers will get to pursue their passions. End users will get better products. The overall level of happiness in the world will be higher.</p>
<p>I would like to see a world where brilliant young software engineers are not risking their mental health (and consequently, their lives) on startup ideas in the hopes of being bought out for a few billion dollars. I would like to see a world where those engineers are not working for large corporations that have neither their employees nor their end users (but rather, their stockholders and advertisers) interests at heart. I would like to see a world where those developers can choose to invest their passion in open source products that will change the world.</p>

<p>Jag har sv&#229;rt att best&#228;mma mig om jag ska anv&#228;nda GNOME 3, DWM eller MATE. Alla &#228;r olika och har sina f&#246;rdelar. Just nu anv&#228;nder jag dock MATE, samtidigt som jag har satt upp DWM s&#229; som jag vill ha det, ifall jag skulle f&#229; f&#246;r mig att b&#246;rja anv&#228;nda det ist&#228;llet. Vad finns det att skriva om MATE d&#229;? Ja, inte speciellt mycket tror jag. Gillar du GNOME 2 s&#229; kommer du att gilla MATE, gillar du snabbhet och enkelhet s&#229; kommer du att gilla MATE.</p>
<p>Jag verkar ha sv&#229;rt att kunna l&#228;gga upp bilder just nu, s&#229; d&#228;rf&#246;r kan jag inte posta en sk&#228;rmbild p&#229; hur det ser ut f&#246;r tillf&#228;llet. Vad jag dock kan g&#246;ra &#228;r att f&#246;rmedla det tema och de ikoner som anv&#228;nds f&#246;r tillf&#228;llet.<br />
GTK thema: <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mint-themes/" target="_blank" title="Mint themes">Mint-themes</a><br />

<p>Efter lite tester r&#229;kade jag f&#246;rst&#246;ra n&#229;gonting. Wingpanel g&#229;r inte l&#228;ngre att starta. N&#229;v&#228;l, jag har planer p&#229; att inf&#246;rskaffa mig en SSD till laptopen i vilket fall och d&#229; kommer det att kr&#228;vas en ominstallation utav systemet, d&#229; kommer jag att installera allt det d&#228;r igen. Tillsvidare f&#229;r faktiskt GNOME funka, n&#229;got jag tycker det &#228;nd&#229; g&#246;r ganska bra. Jag har testat Cinnamon igen, men det &#228;r faktiskt inget som faller mig i smaken. MATE har jag ocks&#229; testat, det var snabbt och relativt stabilt men f&#246;ll inte mig i smaken det heller. Av n&#229;gon anledning kan jag inte installera min v&#228;ldigt modifierade version av DWM, ganska skumt men samtidigt inget jag orkar l&#228;gga ner n&#229;gon st&#246;rre energi vid, &#228;ven om jag &#246;nskar att s&#229; var fallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dessa till&#228;gg har jag till GNOME, de &#228;r alla v&#228;ldigt bra och fyller sin funktion:</p>
