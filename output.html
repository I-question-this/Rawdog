  <p>Three months ago, celebrated video game publisher Valve did something completely out of character: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/13/3985642/great-cleansing-at-valve-software">it fired up to 25 workers</a>, in what one employee dubbed the "great cleansing." At the time, co-founder Gabe Newell quickly reassured gamers that the company <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/13/3986540/valves-gabe-newell-addresses-layoffs-we-arent-canceling-any-projects">wouldn't be canceling any projects</a>, but it just so happens that one project managed to get away.</p>
<p>Valve was secretly working on a pair of augmented reality glasses... and those glasses are still being built by two Valve employees who lost their jobs that day.</p>

  <p>Jorge Almeida has made his name designing the futuristic user interfaces of action and science fiction movies, most notably the extremely influential <i>Minority Report.</i> His work also appears in the recently released <i>Star Trek Into Darkness</i>, and <a href="http://www.inventinginteractive.com/2013/05/16/star-trek-into-darkness/" target="_blank">he's spoken to <i>Inventing Interactive</i></a> about the process, his design influences, and how he came up with the crew's heads-up display. "I wanted to frame it around the actors face in a way that didn't feel too tech," he says. "I was trying to make it feel soothing, with a steady pulse &mdash; that way the animation had somewhere to go when things get dangerous."</p>

  <p>Lush were a British band from 1987 to 1996. Their first full length album, <i>Spooky</i>, is the subject of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/18/4334562/the-classics-lush-spooky">The Classics </a>this week. The playlist below spans their entire career, which included three albums, several EPs, a greatest hits collection, and a lot of B-sides, collected in 1996. Three songs on the playlist are covers, something Lush excelled at by making songs their own without destroying their original tone: Abba's "Hey Hey Helen," Wire's "Outdoor Miner," and Dennis Wilson's "Fallin' In Love." Enjoy.</p>

<p>British band Lush&rsquo;s first full-length album, <i>Spooky</i> (4AD, January, 1992) is a relic of a past which no longer exists, but which incessantly reminds you that it once did. You hear its reverberations in predecessors like Black Tambourine and in successors like Wild Nothing. What ties them all together is a dialogue, a certain way of looking at the world, which has everything to do with the tone, the sound, the feel, and often nothing to do with actual meaning. The meaning is conveyed in the delivery.</p>
<p><i>Spooky </i>operates on the listener like...</p>

  <p>Chinese telecommunications giants ZTE and Huawei are set to face an EU investigation for anti-competitive behavior. Although the pair have both seen moderate success marketing their consumer devices in the region, the investigation is regarding the companies' infrastructure equipment, which provides the backbone for the industry. In recent years Chinese companies have taken around a quarter of of the EU market, with sales of around &euro;1 billion (roughly $1.3 billion). But according to European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht, the success has been due to anti-competitive predatory pricing.</p>

  <p>When<i> Cards Against Humanity </i>saw its <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxtemkin/cards-against-humanity" target="_blank">$4,000 Kickstarter campaign</a> successfully raise almost four times its original goal, its makers were ecstatic. Two years later, the cards-based party game, which is <a href="http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/" target="_blank">available as a free PDF download</a> or for $25 as a ready-made package, has generated an estimated $12 million in revenue, and in the past year alone was downloaded 1.5 million times from its website. It's also spawned a reseller culture, with frequent stock shortages leading opportunists to sell the game for as much as $100 on sites like eBay. Despite that, its makers have stayed true to their cause, and have refused several investment and merchandising offers, preferring to go it alone. <a href="http://www.chicagogrid.com/enterprise/cards-against-humanity-game-money/" target="_blank">A profile from <i>Chicago Grid</i> </a> looks at how the game came...</p>

        <p>Music is something that is universally loved. Even if everyone doesn&#8217;t enjoy the same kind of music, you will be hard-pressed to find an individual that denounces all music as unentertaining.  It is convenient that we all enjoy music as much as we do seeing as it does improve our brain function.  If I had a dollar for every time someone tried to tell me that listening to classical music while studying made remembering material easier, playing Bach for a baby makes them smarter or that Nickelback sucks then I&#8217;d have enough dollars to buy some Tim McGraw Artist Series JBL On-Ear Headphones ($130.00). </p>
<p>One step further form listening to music would be the people who actually play the music. Musicians have improved working memories, can differentiate between sounds better and have more neural paths in their brain than the average Joe.<br>

  <p>To call something "propaganda" is to connote a laughably unsubtle attempt at mind control, from the kind of nasty stereotypes mocked in <i>BioShock Infinite</i> to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/13/how-americans-live-today-north-korea-fake-video_n_2868121.html?utm_hp_ref=tw" target="_blank">hilariously redubbed North Korean propaganda video</a> that many thought was real &mdash; precisely because we expect such attempts to be ham-fisted and idiotic. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/17/west-hidden-propaganda-machine-social-media" target="_blank">At <i>The Guardian</i>, Eliane Glaser argues</a> that we should be looking instead at how behavioral science, advertising, and even memes can nudge us in certain directions. "The notion that propaganda is always a state-run, top-down affair provides a cloak for our complicity," she writes. "Social media's veneer of openness and people-power exemplifies western propaganda's habit of masquerading as its opposite."</p>

        <p>I'm trying to understand <a href="http://www.google.com/hangouts">Google+ Hangouts</a>. It's supposed to replace products and features like Google Talk, Google Chat, Google+ Messenger and to become Google's unified messaging service.<br><br>Let's start with the name. It includes "Google+", so it looks like a Google+ feature. The product actually borrows the name of Google+'s group video chat feature.<br><br>How can you use this product? There are 5 ways: inside Google+ (replaces the Google Chat box), inside Gmail (optionally replaces the Gmail Chat box), using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd">a Chrome extension</a> (has already replaced the Google Chat extension and it requires Google+), <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk">an Android app</a> (gradually replacing the built-in Google Talk app) and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id643496868?mt=8">an iOS app</a> (entirely new, requires Google+). <br><br>As you can see, 3 of the 5 ways to use it require Google+. You can refuse to upgrade to Hangouts in Gmail, but the Gmail Chat feature will eventually be discontinued. Probably most Android users will upgrade from Google Talk to Google+ Hangouts. The only other Google Chat clients are the Google Talk app for Windows and the chat boxes from iGoogle and orkut.<br><br>Google+ Hangouts doesn't require Google+, but most Google+ Hangouts clients require Google+. Actually there are 2 features that are somehow tied to Google+: sharing photos (they're uploaded to Google+ photos) and group chat. Here's what happens when you try to use them in Gmail, without joining Google+:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><a class="imgbutton" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CJrjBwZjBR4/UZayWCcNwYI/AAAAAAABJgg/MYCpmorYPLU/s640/hangouts-gmail-group.png">IMG</a></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><a class="imgbutton" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QUrE38eBRf4/UZayWGxKrYI/AAAAAAABJgk/kjczt1u0jfg/s640/hangouts-gmail-photos.png">IMG</a></div><br>Google+ Hangouts has little in common with Google Chat/Talk, it's actually an upgraded Google+ Messenger. Hangouts focuses on conversations, not people, that's why you won't see a long list of buddies. Ideally, Hangouts lets you communicate with anyone you've added to a Google+ circle or anyone else, if you know his email address or phone number. When you open mobile clients for the first time, Google asks you to verify your phone number and that's optional.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><a class="imgbutton" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XB6iLnl3l_U/UZa1K1r18SI/AAAAAAABJg0/bhvV5J9uURc/s640/hangouts-gmail-new.png">IMG</a></div><br>Many people complain that Hangouts doesn't show if someone is online. Google's new service does away with busy/away/invisible/offline and has a different way to show if some is "connected": a green bar under the photo if someone can reply immediately. It only shows up if someone actually uses the application.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><a class="imgbutton" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hujq-Gb50nk/UZa17hFff2I/AAAAAAABJg8/R4wkIFR6bJ0/s640/hangouts-green-bar.png">IMG</a></div><br>Hangout's tagline is "conversations come to life". Maybe because there are hundreds of emojis you can add to your messages, maybe because there's video chat, maybe because of the presence signals. "Hangouts inserts tiny little square avatars into the chat history, called 'watermarks.' These watermarks show when somebody else is typing, but they also indicate how far others have read in the conversation," <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4318830/inside-hangouts-googles-big-fix-for-its-messaging-mess">reports The Verge</a>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><a class="imgbutton" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W59x0QNTVok/UZa2s4LAbkI/AAAAAAABJhI/Qsuk0p5SmKM/s640/hangouts-gmail-intro.png">IMG</a></div><br>Google+ Hangouts lacks many features from Google Chat: voice chat, phone calls, sending SMS, <a href="http://www.googletutor.com/google-talk-facts-tips-and-tricks/">formatting tricks</a>. You can now <a href="https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/3112005?hl=en&ref_topic=2944848">use keyboard shortcuts</a>, but only for the desktop clients. Hangouts has <a href="https://plus.google.com/117596712775912423303/posts/MFHshpinpeJ">its own Easter Eggs</a> and they're really funny. Unfortunately, Hangouts <a href="https://developers.google.com/talk/">drops support for server-to-server XMPP</a>, it can't interact with other XMPP apps/services. It still works with Gmail Chat and Google Talk, though.<br><br>So what's Google+ Hangouts, after all? "The single communication app that we want our users to rely on," <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4318830/inside-hangouts-googles-big-fix-for-its-messaging-mess">says Nikhyl Singhal</a>, from Google. "We don't see Hangouts as a messaging product, we see it as a communication product," says product manager Kate Cushing.<br><br>Hangouts <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/plus">lets you decide</a> for each Google+ circle if you want to be added to a hangout by its members or if you want them to send a request. Notifications are supposed to be synchronized for all your devices, so you only see them once, but I got multiple notifications.<br><br>Google+ is about <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-google-project-real-life.html">real-life sharing</a>, so Hangouts is built on top of the original Hangouts and Messenger features. The initial name of Google+ Messenger was Huddle, which means "draw together for an informal, private conversation".<br><br>The Talk era was about openness, the Chat era was about ubiquity, the Hangouts era is about Google+, the new Google that's all about social and mobile. From OpenSocial to ClosedSocial, from <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-all-way.html">OpenMessaging</a> to ClosedMessaging, from <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2005/11/lots-to-talk-about.html">idealism</a> to realism.<div class="feedflare">

  <p>It appears that Canada will become the latest country to look into the business practices of search giant Google. <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2013/05/17/google-canada-investigation-competition-bureau/?__lsa=f640-14e2" target="_blank"><i>The Financial Post</i> reports</a> that Canada's Competition Bureau &mdash; a law-enforcement agency focused on ensuring competitive conditions in the marketplace &mdash; has notified Google that it will be investigating the company's Canadian operations. It's not clear at this time what the scope of the investigation will be, or what specific Google products and services will be targeted.</p>
<p>The investigation will follow a series of other Google investigations, including ones launched by the Federal Trade Commission and EU regulators. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/3/3832182/ftc-reaches-settlement-with-google-bringing-antitrust-investigation">Google reached a settlement with the FTC</a> earlier this year; the company <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/11/4213548/google-makes-settlement-offer-in-eu-antitrust-probe">offered to make changes</a> to address EU...</p>

  <p>It's easy to miss the Google TV booth here at I/O 2013, hidden in the corner of the third floor. That may not be an accident: there was apparently no room in the company's <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4334634/best-of-googles-i-o-2013-keynote-hangouts-google-galaxy-s4">sprawling three-and-a-half-hour keynote</a> to mention Google TV, either, just a short blog post hours later announcing that it <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4334210/google-tv-updated-jelly-bean-current-version-chrome/in/4095431">now runs the latest version of Android</a>. So in a sea of new products, services, and pitches to developers, we couldn't help but wonder: is TV dead? Google has killed plenty of products with many more fans than Google TV &mdash; will it go <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101144/google-shuts-down-reader-rss-aggregation-service">the way of Reader</a>?</p>

  <p>A group of cybersecurity experts has come out in opposition to a White House-backed <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/29/4282680/fines-proposed-for-companies-fail-wiretap-orders" target="_blank">proposal</a> that would dramatically expand the FBI's wiretapping capabilities for internet communication services.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.cdt.org/files/pdfs/CALEAII-techreport.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a>, the group argues against new regulations under what's being called CALEA II, an extension to the 1994 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act" target="_blank">Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act</a>, which mandated law enforcement backdoor access for telephone networks. The new regulation would do something similar for internet communications, threatening heavy fines on companies that do not comply with wiretapping orders. That means that all apps would need to be built or rebuilt to be wiretap-ready, just in case they need to accomodate a law enforcement...</p>

Ophelia will ship in May to developers, with cable providers and telecoms able to buy it in July. A consumer release will follow shortly thereafter. When it does ship, the tiny device (about the same size as a portable USB stick) will convert any HDMI-ready display into an Android computer. Naturally Google Play is built right in, so you'll have access to your entire library of Android software. Essentially, Project Ophelia is what you make of it; it can act as a portable gaming console much in the same vein as Ouya.

  <p>Every time a reality TV star's mouth is pixelated to obscure a curse, the producers are using a technique pioneered for Yul Brynner's killer robot in <i>Westworld</i>. John Whitney Jr., who created the effect for director and writer Michael Crichton, wanted to simulate how an android might see the world. To do so, he divided the screen into tiny squares, calculating the average color of each one, and filling them with that color, creating a shifting low-resolution version of normal vision. It was a simpler, cheaper design than Crichton's desired "bizarre, computerized image of the world," but it also likely proved more timeless: it's since become an accepted convention for obscuring a video. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/05/crichton-lucas-forty-years-of-pixels-at-the-movies.html" target="_blank"><i>The New Yorker</i> has the full story</a>, including more...</p>

  <p>NASA's Curiosity rover has stolen much of the spotlight on Mars lately with its discoveries of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/12/4094534/nasa-curiosity-rover-discovers-ancient-mars-could-have" target="_blank">once-watery environments</a> and strange, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/11/3978190/nasa-mars-metallic-object-eroded-rock" target="_blank">door-handle shaped rocks</a>. But this week, NASA's older rover Opportunity <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20130516.html" target="_blank">drove into the history books</a>, becoming the furthest NASA object to travel on the surface of another body in the solar system. Opportunity's total 22.22 miles driven on Mars since landing there January 2004 is still short of the all-time record for interplanetary driving, the 23 miles that the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 rover drove over the surface of the Moon in 1973. But Opportunity's long journey beats NASA's previous record, the 19.3 miles that NASA astronauts traveled in the Apollo 17 lunar rover in 1972.</p>

  <p>Yahoo is on the brink of acquiring Tumblr for $1.1 billion in cash, according to a new report. <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130517/yahoo-board-to-meet-sunday-to-consider-1-1-billion-all-cash-deal-to-acquire-tumblr/?mod=atdtweet" target="_blank"><i>All Things D</i></a>, which first broke the news that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/16/4338760/yahoo-tumblr-billion-acquisition-rumors">a deal was in the works</a>, says Yahoo's board will meet on Sunday to consider an all-cash offer for the popular blogging platform. The deal would be Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's largest to date and would reportedly form the centerpiece of her effort to revitalize the company by acquiring younger users.</p>
<p>News of the potential deal surfaced hours after Yahoo invited the press to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/17/4341144/yahoo-to-hold-monday-press-event-nyc-tumblr-acquisition-rumors">a special event</a> Monday in New York City.

Bloomberg reported that the event would include <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-17/yahoo-s-mayer-said-to-be-preparing-updates-for-flickr-photo-site.html">an update on Flickr</a>.</p>

I posted a couple of weeks ago about
<a href="http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/03/29/vim/" title="Post on Vim">Building Vim</a> and how,
using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Abs" title="Arch Build System on the Wiki">ABS</a>
and <code>makepkg</code> it is possible to customize packages in the repositories to suit your
individual requirements, in that case with a specific feature set.</p>

<p>One of Arch's real strengths is in the flexibility that <code>makepkg</code> and PKGBUILDs provide
the community; the ability to adapt official packages&#8212;or unofficial ones in the
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/" title="Arch User Repository">AUR</a>&#8212;as you see fit. As PKGBUILDs
are just shell scripts, the entry level to start playing around with them is quite
low<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>A fairly standard, and simple, example of the type of customization that I might make
is with <a href="http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/" title="dmenu page">dmenu</a>, the suckless dynamic
menu, where the
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/dmenu/" title="Arch package">standard package</a>
in the Arch repositories is not patched for Xft support. There is a patch for this on the
<a href="http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/xft" title="Xft patch on suckless.org">suckless wiki</a>, so it
is just a case of making the requisite changes in the PKGBUILD from ABS and building it.</p>

<p>As you can see from the <code>diff</code> below, there is not a lot involved in this exercize; essentially,
adding <code>libxft</code> as a dependency, sourcing the patch from the suckless site (and including the
hash for it), and then in the <code>build</code> function ensuring that the patch is applied and the
Makefile updated with the new library:</p>

<p>Running <code>makepkg -i</code> will build and install dmenu with Xft support. This is the most
straightforward approach. I also, primarily by way of experimentation and in an effort
to try an understand how this actually works, have slightly more convoluted examples.
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/msmtp/" title="Arch package">msmtp</a>, the
<acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> client has a couple
of makedepends in
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libgnome-keyring/" title="Arch package">libgnome-keyring</a>
and <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/texlive-core/" title="Arch package">texlive-core</a>; the former
I have zero use for and the latter is only installed on my desktop, so I have no wish to install it on
my laptop just to be able to send emails&#8230;</p>

<p>In this case, I modified the PKGBUILD to completely remove the <code>libgnome-keyring</code> dependency
and to only build the <code>msmtp</code> documentation in <code>.pdf</code> and <code>.html</code> if <code>texlive-core</code> was
already installed on the machine. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test for the presence of
<code>texlive-core</code> with the standard utilities like <code>type</code> or <code>which</code>, so&#8212;as it is installed
on all my boxes&#8212;I went with <code>expac</code> (<code>pacman -Q</code> would also work):</p>

<p>It isn't necessarily an attractive solution, but it works for me&#8230;
On the subject of unattractive solutions, as of pacman 4.1, released
last month, the packaging standards for
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VCS_PKGBUILD_Guidelines" title="Arch Wiki page">VCS PKGBUILDs</a>
have been changed, principally around how sources and versioning is handled. For
the couple of VCS packages I maintain in the <acronym title="Arch User Repository">AUR</acronym><sup>2</sup>, I have been
experimenting with how to capture the <code>pkgver</code> in a way that conforms to the
standards and provides people with a meaningful version number.</p>

<p>By default, the version number for these projects from their git repos
is not that helpful:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
git describe --always
4861046
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>After looking through the git logs, and playing around with <code>awk</code> to filter
the results, I came up with this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
pkgver() {
  cd "$<em>gitname"
  printf '%s\n' "$(awk '/^ / {print $2}' &lt;(git log --grep=version -1))</em>\
  $(git describe --always)"
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>This prints a more, for me anyway, intelligble package version: <code>vimprobable2-git
1.2.1_c5936cc-1</code> that relates back to the last stable release and appends the
current commit. I'm sure that this could be improved upon; suggestions are
welcome.</p>

<p>The other change to note in all of these PKGBUILDs is the inclusion of the
<code>groups</code> variable. By adding all of the modified packages from the official
repositories to the&#8212;imaginatively titled&#8212;<code>modified</code> group, I can then add a line
to <code>/etc/pacman.conf</code> that prevents those packages from being overwritten on
upgrade<sup>3</sup>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:sh %}
IgnoreGroup = modified
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Issuing <code>pacman -Syu</code>, or running <code>checkupdates</code> from a <code>cron</code> job, will
notify you that the packages have had a version bump and that they need
to be rebuilt. The PKGBUILDs for all of these packages can be found in

  <p>Bang With Friends, the somewhat-controversial hookup app that lets users anonymously pick which of their Facebook friends they'd like to "bang" and then notifies users when there's a match, has had its iPhone app pulled from the App Store. There's no word on why yet &mdash; the Bang With Friends site simply says that "we're working with Apple to get BWF back into the App Store shortly." The app may have a clever premise that could be used to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/11/4319774/editorial-bang-with-friends-hides-a-good-idea">revolutionize all kinds of social interaction</a>, but given the risque subject matter, we're not entirely surprised to hear that it's gone. While we all know at this point that Apple can ban apps with near-impunity, but if the company finds Bang With Friends so objectionable, why approve the app in the...</p>

  <p>Residents in the Boston area will have the chance to see a pretty unique art installation this weekend. On Sunday evening,  hundreds of LED-enabled umbrellas will light up Cambridge thanks to a collaboration between MIT and a Connecticut-based dance group known as Pilobolus. The event is called UP: The Umbrella Project and was first performed up in Camden, Maine last October. Over 300 members of the MIT student body, faculty, and staff will participate; each gets an umbrella lined with red, green, and blue LED lights plus a controller to let them change the lighting as they see fit, and all of the movements will be broadcast onto a large inflatable screen so that the performers can see their movements.</p>

    <div class="itemdescription" id="itemhttp://elementaryos.org/journal/we-moved-cheese">
        <div>
<p>Every once in a while, somebody makes a design decision that irritates a very vocal portion of their users. The other day, we did that by removing the preferences dialog from Files. We moved the cheese. We didn&#8217;t get rid of it though, and we think that's important to note. Here&#8217;s the logic behind the move.</p>
<h2>Auto-selection</h2>
<p>The good news is that we&#8217;ve heard absolutely zero people complain about not having easy access to the auto-select feature. This used to be the default. And it was awful. And so we moved it, and I think now is a good time to simply remove it. Not much more to say here.</p>
<h2>Date settings</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, there are a few people that are up in arms about not having the date configuration in Files. But really ask yourself if this makes sense to have in that app. Date isn&#8217;t something that only Files deals with; we use dates all over the system in all kinds of apps. By default, Files now respects your system settings with regards to how the date should be displayed. Maybe it isn&#8217;t perfect right now, but we&#8217;ve moved the setting where it should be: system-wide.</p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>Several people are upset about not being able to access extensions in Files. This hasn&#8217;t been removed either! Extensions are handled in Software Center and they are enabled when you install them. We have heard some complaints about managing extensions per-user and be assured that we&#8217;re working on a way to handle extensions more intelligently in the future without compromising on security. But we think Files is a safe place to start the transition since there are very few extensions currently available and none of them are particularly intrusive.</p>
<p>Overall, think of this as a stepping stone to a greater extensions experience for all the apps on elementary. As always, we need your feedback to help make it rock. What kind of problems are you running in to? How can we make this easier and better?</p>
<h2>Single vs Double Click</h2>
<p>This is the setting that really freaked a lot of people out. Why would we remove such a vital and important setting such as being able to click an extra time in order to open something? If you really think about it, double-click is just a weird thing we&#8217;ve kept around since the old days. Sometimes genuinely liking something and simply being used to something are two different things. All modern interfaces are single click. The entire web is single click! But you probably have your reasons, so here is what we want to suggest to you:</p>
<p>Just try it out. Any change takes a bit of time to get used to. Give it a couple of days before you reach a conclusion. Find good reasons why single click won&#8217;t work for you and then report those reasons <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fbugs.launchpad.net%2Fpantheon-files">here</a>. We want to make our apps better, not worse. If there&#8217;s a genuine problem, we need to know about it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t have preconceived notions. We&#8217;ve already heard people exclaiming &#8220;I need to be able to select multiple files!&#8221; If you&#8217;ve ever tried it, you know that you can still use ctrl + click to select files and folders without opening them, and we even have handy + and - buttons for multi-selection with just the mouse.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a developer, we still need a mouse and touchpad settings pane to replace the old GNOME one we&#8217;re using right now. That is really the proper place to put a single vs double-click setting if we really want one. Settings panes aren&#8217;t hard to code. It&#8217;ll take you maybe a day and you&#8217;ll get a lot of praise from the community. Everybody wins.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s All Part of The Plan</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t panic! This is just part of the grand scheme of providing options contextually, globally, and auto-configuring apps intelligently. For the past two years we've had a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&u=http%3A%2F%2Felementaryos.org%2Fdocs%2Favoid-configuration">section about this</a> in our HIG. We&#8217;re not going to just start removing dialogs from apps where they make sense to have. This wasn&#8217;t a random decision made in a single day: we created a <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprints.launchpad.net%2Fpantheon-files%2F%2Bspec%2Faxe-prefs">blueprint</a>, we discussed the implications of the change, and we only acted after we were really sure.</p>
<p>Way back when GNOME 2 was still king, we introduced the second version of wingpanel (the first version was a disaster). A very vocal number of people were extremely upset that wingpanel was not configurable. They wanted the panel on the left or the bottom and 48px wide and to add shortcuts in the middle and applets etc. Today, almost nobody complains about this. And better, we don&#8217;t get a single confused user wondering how they moved their panel or accidentally deleted the clock or worse the entire panel. We made some decisions about how the panel should be organized, where it should be located, and what kind of customization we wanted to allow (plug-able indicators and full CSS theming) and this yielded a much faster, lighter, sleeker panel.</p>
<p>We know there are many traditional Linux users out there exclaiming that Linux is all about choices and we should make everything configurable because that&#8217;s freedom. But that isn&#8217;t why most of you are here in the first place. You&#8217;re here because we&#8217;ve been making choices for you. Lots of them. We always have and always will. We&#8217;re the open source OS with opinionated design. That&#8217;s what makes elementary so good. We trim the fat. We optimize. We organize. We rethink.</p>

  <p>Cellphone carriers have generally met net neutrality proposals with varying levels of hostility, but Verizon and MetroPCS have been particularly belligerent: in 2011, they <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2011/01/metropcs-net-neutrality-challenge/" target="_blank">sued to overturn</a> the FCC's then-newly adopted Open Internet rules. Since then, the two have <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/1/3586546/verizon-metropcs-fcc-appeal-net-neutrality">consistently argued in court against the rules</a>, which they've said undermine the freedom to run their networks as they see fit. But as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4286622/t-mobile-us-metropcs-merger-complete-tmus">T-Mobile finalizes its merger</a> with MetroPCS, it's decided it doesn't want an old lawsuit to come with its new spectrum. In a court statement filed today, T-Mobile has moved to dismiss its appeals claim.</p>
<p>T-Mobile's decision to back out doesn't mean the suit is over. Verizon will continue its litigation, though the court document indicates that it...</p>

  <p>The Verge is in San Francisco for the 2013 Google I/O conference. We take the time to reflect on the three hour developer keynote, check out some of Google's not-so-official projects, and catch up with Bradley Horowitz to talk about Google's new unified Hangouts app and the redesigned Google+.</p>

        <p>Google Accounts settings page has a new feature called "<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/smsextensions/">SMS for Hangouts</a>". You can "add your phone number to receive messages from Google+ Hangouts as SMS, when you are idle."

  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/335470093876207616" target="_blank">CNBC is reporting</a> that Yahoo will hold a "product-related" news event this Monday in New York City. None other than CEO Marissa Mayer will be speaking at the event. Exactly what Yahoo plans to announce hasn't yet been disclosed, but news of the event comes in the midst of rumors <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/16/4338760/yahoo-tumblr-billion-acquisition-rumors">pointing to an acquisition of Tumblr.</a> The extraordinarily popular microblogging site is based out of Manhattan, so the location would make sense if a deal has indeed been finalized.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that Yahoo could spend up to $1 billion for Tumblr, which would represent Mayer's biggest spend yet after high profile acquisitions of Summly and Astrid. The company has also recently signed exclusive content partnerships that will bring it video programming from...</p>

  <p>For the first time in over a decade, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/20/4126936/copyright-register-today-will-embark-on-mission-to-overhaul-us">Congress is looking at a major copyright overhaul</a>. But before it happens, the House Judiciary Committee is looking backwards, at both a 3-year-old copyright report and what it sees as an earlier, quieter time, when intellectual property debates were the province of the courtroom rather than the internet. Behind it all is a simple question: why are people so upset about copyright law?</p>
